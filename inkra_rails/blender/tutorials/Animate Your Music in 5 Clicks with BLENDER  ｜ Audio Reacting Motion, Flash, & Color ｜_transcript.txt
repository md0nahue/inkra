we're talking about secrets for creating awesome 3D about secrets for creating awesome 3D about secrets for creating awesome 3D music videos so to understand what we're music videos so to understand what we're music videos so to understand what we're trying to do let's take a look at some trying to do let's take a look at some trying to do let's take a look at some great visuals that react with the audio great visuals that react with the audio great visuals that react with the audio and keyword there react with the audio and keyword there react with the audio and keyword there react with the audio this entire video is going to be about this entire video is going to be about this entire video is going to be about the audio visual relationship the audio visual relationship the audio visual relationship translating the sound you hear into translating the sound you hear into translating the sound you hear into colors you see motion you see and other colors you see motion you see and other colors you see motion you see and other things along that line so the first one things along that line so the first one things along that line so the first one here this is a concert Visual and the here this is a concert Visual and the here this is a concert Visual and the thing I want to get across it doesn't thing I want to get across it doesn't thing I want to get across it doesn't matter what genre you're doing it's matter what genre you're doing it's matter what genre you're doing it's always going to keep the same core always going to keep the same core always going to keep the same core values for making everything react now values for making everything react now values for making everything react now unfortunately I can't play the audio unfortunately I can't play the audio unfortunately I can't play the audio with this visual because of copyright with this visual because of copyright with this visual because of copyright issues but anytime you hear a bass issues but anytime you hear a bass issues but anytime you hear a bass strike you're seeing this 3D visualizer strike you're seeing this 3D visualizer strike you're seeing this 3D visualizer slam on the ground anytime you hear some slam on the ground anytime you hear some slam on the ground anytime you hear some snares you're seeing these lasers snares you're seeing these lasers snares you're seeing these lasers they're relating different movements to they're relating different movements to they're relating different movements to different sounds the relating different different sounds the relating different different sounds the relating different flashing and different colors to flashing and different colors to flashing and different colors to different sounds that's all about different sounds that's all about different sounds that's all about creating that audio visual relationship creating that audio visual relationship creating that audio visual relationship and whenever you do that in a music and whenever you do that in a music and whenever you do that in a music video or a music video visualizer you video or a music video visualizer you video or a music video visualizer you can create some really cool looking can create some really cool looking can create some really cool looking stuff so another example Edward of we've stuff so another example Edward of we've stuff so another example Edward of we've talked about him a bunch on the channel talked about him a bunch on the channel talked about him a bunch on the channel again I can't play the audio but every again I can't play the audio but every again I can't play the audio but every time you hear a bass strike you're time you hear a bass strike you're time you hear a bass strike you're seeing that flashing you're seeing seeing that flashing you're seeing seeing that flashing you're seeing you're seeing the flashing mouth you're you're seeing the flashing mouth you're you're seeing the flashing mouth you're seeing different things happening that seeing different things happening that seeing different things happening that relate to the audio and bring that to relate to the audio and bring that to relate to the audio and bring that to life so that should give you a good idea life so that should give you a good idea life so that should give you a good idea I'm going to leave a link to both of I'm going to leave a link to both of I'm going to leave a link to both of these below if you want to check them these below if you want to check them these below if you want to check them out we're going to hop into blender now out we're going to hop into blender now out we're going to hop into blender now and I'm gonna show you some of the tools and I'm gonna show you some of the tools and I'm gonna show you some of the tools behind creating some of these looks behind creating some of these looks behind creating some of these looks alright guys so here we are within alright guys so here we are within alright guys so here we are within blender I'm gonna go ahead and just blender I'm gonna go ahead and just blender I'm gonna go ahead and just speed run a basic music visualizer setup speed run a basic music visualizer setup speed run a basic music visualizer setup of course you can design it however of course you can design it however of course you can design it however you'd like so I'm going to click shift a you'd like so I'm going to click shift a you'd like so I'm going to click shift a I'm going to add in a plane I'm going to add in a plane I'm going to add in a plane and let's open up this here and we're and let's open up this here and we're and let's open up this here and we're just going to give it a bit more size just going to give it a bit more size just going to give it a bit more size we can tab in edit mode right click and we can tab in edit mode right click and we can tab in edit mode right click and subdivide it give it some Cuts Like a grid and then give it some Cuts Like a grid and then give it some Cuts Like a grid and then we can go to our modifiers and add in a we can go to our modifiers and add in a we can go to our modifiers and add in a wireframe modifier so we have this wireframe modifier so we have this wireframe modifier so we have this little grid background give it some little grid background give it some little grid background give it some thickness thickness thickness and rotate it 90 degrees like that so and rotate it 90 degrees like that so and rotate it 90 degrees like that so simple little background I'm also going simple little background I'm also going simple little background I'm also going to bring in here to bring in here to bring in here just a simple little obj model that is just a simple little obj model that is just a simple little obj model that is from my 3D starter pack so these are all from my 3D starter pack so these are all from my 3D starter pack so these are all basically like music videoesque 3D basically like music videoesque 3D basically like music videoesque 3D models you don't need these you can models you don't need these you can models you don't need these you can download

my other videos if you're interested in some designing tips for interested in some designing tips for interested in some designing tips for this but again extremely simple you see this but again extremely simple you see this but again extremely simple you see this set up in a bunch of different this set up in a bunch of different this set up in a bunch of different dubstep Style music videos dubstep Style music videos dubstep Style music videos where we have our backgrounds and we where we have our backgrounds and we where we have our backgrounds and we have some sort of subject like this so have some sort of subject like this so have some sort of subject like this so some tips for making this sort of thing some tips for making this sort of thing some tips for making this sort of thing react to music the first thing we can do react to music the first thing we can do react to music the first thing we can do we can think about how we want this to we can think about how we want this to we can think about how we want this to react to the audio we want it to rotate react to the audio we want it to rotate react to the audio we want it to rotate whenever the beat hits do we want it to whenever the beat hits do we want it to whenever the beat hits do we want it to jump up and down with scale do we want jump up and down with scale do we want jump up and down with scale do we want it to flash a certain color so let's it to flash a certain color so let's it to flash a certain color so let's start simple start simple start simple let's just click over to our object let's just click over to our object let's just click over to our object properties and we have our location our properties and we have our location our properties and we have our location our rotation our scale so let's make the rotation our scale so let's make the rotation our scale so let's make the scale react with the audio so I'm going scale react with the audio so I'm going scale react with the audio so I'm going to hover over the scale at the very to hover over the scale at the very to hover over the scale at the very beginning here and I'm just going to beginning here and I'm just going to beginning here and I'm just going to click I on my keyboard that will insert click I on my keyboard that will insert click I on my keyboard that will insert a keyframe and if we switch from the a keyframe and if we switch from the a keyframe and if we switch from the timeline view to the graph editor now timeline view to the graph editor now timeline view to the graph editor now you can see these lines here and you see you can see these lines here and you see you can see these lines here and you see our XY our X scale our y scale and our Z our XY our X scale our y scale and our Z our XY our X scale our y scale and our Z scale so if we don't have the keyframes scale so if we don't have the keyframes scale so if we don't have the keyframes there and this is very important we take there and this is very important we take there and this is very important we take that away you'll see everything that away you'll see everything that away you'll see everything disappears from our graph editor so if disappears from our graph editor so if disappears from our graph editor so if you're not seeing anything it's because you're not seeing anything it's because you're not seeing anything it's because you don't have that starting keyframe you don't have that starting keyframe you don't have that starting keyframe for the value you're trying to link to for the value you're trying to link to for the value you're trying to link to the audio so let's bring that back and the audio so let's bring that back and the audio so let's bring that back and hover over hover over scale click I and hover over hover over scale click I and hover over hover over scale click I and it should keyframe all three of our it should keyframe all three of our it should keyframe all three of our scale values so now what we're going to scale values so now what we're going to scale values so now what we're going to do is we're going to do the standard way do is we're going to do the standard way do is we're going to do the standard way to link our audio and that is by to link our audio and that is by to link our audio and that is by selecting one of these selecting one of these selecting one of these or all of them go to key you want to go or all of them go to key you want to go or all of them go to key you want to go up to bake sound to F curves so this up to bake sound to F curves so this up to bake sound to F curves so this will convert any Sound audio file that will convert any Sound audio file that will convert any Sound audio file that you have here into keyframes or Curves you have here into keyframes or Curves you have here into keyframes or Curves as you can see as you can see as you can see so every time this goes up it means the so every time this goes up it means the so every time this goes up it means the volume is getting more loud very simple volume is getting more loud very simple volume is getting more loud very simple way of having it react to the audio way of having it react to the audio way of having it react to the audio now that's the beginner method this is now that's the beginner method this is now that's the beginner method this is our secret tricks we've already talked our secret tricks we've already talked our secret tricks we've already talked about how to do this let's go a lot more about how to do this let's go a lot more about how to do this let's go a lot more in depth so first of all the only other in depth so first of all the only other in depth so first of all the only other thing you should know here if you want thing you should know here if you want thing you should know here if you want to hear the audio while you're doing to hear the audio while you're doing to hear the audio while you're doing this very important so you can actually this very important so you can actually this very important so you can actually see how things are syncing up go to the see how things are syncing up go to the see how things are syncing up go to the video sequencer video sequencer video sequencer go to the beginning click add and then go to the beginning click add and then go to the beginning click add and then you can load in your audio files you can load in your audio files you can load in your audio files straight from here as well so now you straight from here as well so now you straight from here as well so now you can hear this is just some royalty-free can hear this is just some royalty-free can hear this is just some royalty-free music hopefully it doesn't Echo from my music hopefully it doesn't Echo from my music hopefully it doesn't Echo from my mic so we know the basics of linking some so we know the basics of linking some so we know the basics of linking some sort of value to audio now let's take it sort of value to audio now let's take it sort of value to audio now let's take it one step further I'm going to go ahead one step further I'm going to go ahead one step further I'm going to go ahead and right click and remove the keyframes and right click and remove the keyframes and right click and remove the keyframes off of our scale so this will go back to off of our scale so this will go back to off of our scale so this will go back to normal let's try that exact same thing normal let's try that exact same thing normal let's try that exact same thing with color so we're going to go and with color so we're going to go and with color so we're going to go and create a new material and let's put it create a new material and let's put it create a new material and let's put it on the grid to start on the grid to start on the grid to start so we'll go to our materials here we'll so we'll go to our materials here we'll so we'll go to our materials here we'll create new create new create new and I'm going to double click and name and I'm going to double click and name and I'm going to double click and name this audio reacting color so click this audio reacting color so click this audio reacting color so click change from our timeline to our Shader change from our timeline to our Shader change from our timeline to our Shader editor so we can take a look at this editor so we can take a look at this editor so we can take a look at this material now we want to keep this very material now we want to keep this very material now we want to keep this very simple we don't need the principal bsdf simple we don't need the principal bsdf simple we don't need the principal bsdf let's just click shift a and we're going let's just click shift a and we're going let's just click shift a and we're going to search for an emission to search for an emission to search for an emission so in a mission so in a mission so in a mission you can connect that to surface you can connect that to surface you can connect that to surface and then if we bump this up we'll have and then if we bump this up we'll have and then if we bump this up we'll have some strength and you're not seeing some strength and you're not seeing some strength and you're not seeing anything because we're just in the anything because we're just in the anything because we're just in the standard viewport shading let's change standard viewport shading let's change standard viewport shading let's change to rendered mode and you can see this is to rendered mode and you can see this is to rendered mode and you can see this is how you get that nice glowing color how you get that nice glowing color how you get that nice glowing color so we'll put that up to 100 you're not so we'll put that up to 100 you're not so we'll put that up to 100 you're not actually seeing any glow like this actually seeing any glow like this actually seeing any glow like this because you need to enable that in the because you need to enable that in the because you need to enable that in the render settings so in render properties render settings so in render properties render settings so in render properties Bloom there you go Bloom there you go Bloom there you go so we're glowing now let's say we want so we're glowing now let's say we want so we're glowing now let's say we want to link this to the audio we wanted to to link this to the audio we wanted to to link this to the audio we wanted to change the strength with the audio so change the strength with the audio so change the strength with the audio so that it'll flash with the song we want that it'll flash with the song we want that it'll flash with the song we want it to change colors with the audio it to change colors with the audio it to change colors with the audio to be able to do that first let's add in to be able to do that first let's add in to be able to do that first let's add in a little way to change colors we're a little way to change colors we're a little way to change colors we're gonna go in here we're going to click gonna go in here we're going to click gonna go in here we're going to click shift a and we're going to add in a shift a and we're going to add in a shift a and we're going to add in a color ramp node color ramp node color ramp node probably one of the most important nodes probably one of the most important nodes probably one of the most important nodes in blender in my opinion in blender in my opinion in blender in my opinion we're going to connect the color to the we're going to connect the color to the we're going to connect the color to the color of the emission and now this will color of the emission and now this will color of the emission and now this will drive the color that we're going for so drive the color that we're going for so drive the color that we're going for so what you can do here is you can choose what you can do here is you can choose what you can do here is you can choose the colors that you'd like to set for the colors that you'd like to set for the colors that you'd like to set for your visualizer so say if the music is your visualizer so say if the music is your visualizer so say if the music is very quiet you want it to be something very quiet you want it to be something very quiet you want it to be something like blue like blue like blue we can change this to light blue if you we can change this to light blue if you we can change this to light blue if you want it to be super loud we can make it want it to be super loud we can make it want it to be super loud we can make it red red red so whenever it starts out all calm and so whenever it starts out all calm and so whenever it starts out all calm and smooth it's going to be very blue in the smooth it's going to be very blue in the smooth it's going to be very blue in the middle it's going to be this nice purple middle it's going to be this nice purple middle it's going to be this nice purple because it's Blended between the two and because it's Blended between the two and because it's Blended between the two and as it gets super crazy and Bassy as it gets super crazy and Bassy as it gets super crazy and Bassy at your B traps it's going to flash red at your B traps it's going to flash red at your B traps it's going to flash red and of course you guys can add in other and of course you guys can add in other and of course you guys can add in other things here maybe you don't want uh things here maybe you don't want uh things here maybe you don't want uh purple to be your midpoint maybe you can purple to be your midpoint maybe you can purple to be your midpoint maybe you can add in like some rainbow colors add in like some rainbow colors add in like some rainbow colors and really customize this to your liking and really customize this to your liking and really customize this to your liking but that's the basic principle of it so but that's the basic principle of it so but that's the basic principle of it so once you have something like that set up once you have something like that set up once you have something like that set up it's really just using those exact same it's really just using those exact same it's really just using those exact same steps to be able to link it up to the steps to be able to link it up to the steps to be able to link it up to the audio so if we want to link audio to audio so if we want to link audio to audio so if we want to link audio to color you want to keyframe the factor color you want to keyframe the factor color you want to keyframe the factor here so hover over Factor click I at the here so hover over Factor click I at the here so hover over Factor click I at the start and keyframe one and now let's go start and keyframe one and now let's go start and keyframe one and now let's go to our graph editor to our graph editor to our graph editor now if for any reason you're not seeing now if for any reason you're not seeing now if for any reason you're not seeing that you may need to uncheck the only that you may need to uncheck the only that you may need to uncheck the only show selected show selected show selected and now you can see this popping up and now you can see this popping up and now you can see this popping up this is from what we selected in our this is from what we selected in our this is from what we selected in our Shader node tree and here is what we Shader node tree and here is what we Shader node tree and here is what we just set a keyframe for the factor of just set a keyframe for the factor of just set a keyframe for the factor of our color ramp and we can do the same our color ramp and we can do the same our color ramp and we can do the same thing he bake sound to F curves thing he bake sound to F curves thing he bake sound to F curves there we go so it's very calm at the start [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] what we can do is let's give ourselves what we can do is let's give ourselves what we can do is let's give ourselves some more time here I'm just going to click that open to I'm just going to click that open to I'm just going to click that open to drag in a new window so we can see this drag in a new window so we can see this drag in a new window so we can see this Of All Times make it a bit easier let's Of All Times make it a bit easier let's Of All Times make it a bit easier let's go to the parts of the song that start go to the parts of the song that start go to the parts of the song that start to get loud here's our beat drop to get loud here's our beat drop to get loud here's our beat drop [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so pretty cool and you have full control so pretty cool and you have full control so pretty cool and you have full control over what colors you'd like for over what colors you'd like for over what colors you'd like for different parts of the song it's all different parts of the song it's all different parts of the song it's all being driven by this value here you can being driven by this value here you can being driven by this value here you can think of this bottom line here as zero think of this bottom line here as zero think of this bottom line here as zero anything above zero is going to affect anything above zero is going to affect anything above zero is going to affect the value so the higher this line goes the value so the higher this line goes the value so the higher this line goes up on the graph the more this factor is up on the graph the more this factor is up on the graph the more this factor is going to be bumped up so you see right going to be bumped up so you see right going to be bumped up so you see right now it's at 0.18 if we go to where it's now it's at 0.18 if we go to where it's now it's at 0.18 if we go to where it's spiked up here it's at 1.594 and that's spiked up here it's at 1.594 and that's spiked up here it's at 1.594 and that's in the range of our deeper colors here in the range of our deeper colors here in the range of our deeper colors here but you can take this one step even but you can take this one step even but you can take this one step even further what if you want things to flash further what if you want things to flash further what if you want things to flash in and out in and out in and out and you can think of this like zero and and you can think of this like zero and and you can think of this like zero and one values so if we look at this graph one values so if we look at this graph one values so if we look at this graph here again if you think of this blue here again if you think of this blue here again if you think of this blue line here this is zero everything above line here this is zero everything above line here this is zero everything above that is one so at all times this line is that is one so at all times this line is that is one so at all times this line is above zero so it's always going to be above zero so it's always going to be above zero so it's always going to be lit up and have color but if you want lit up and have color but if you want lit up and have color but if you want things to flash with the song you need things to flash with the song you need things to flash with the song you need to lower this line below zero so that to lower this line below zero so that to lower this line below zero so that only the Peaks are sticking up and to do only the Peaks are sticking up and to do only the Peaks are sticking up and to do that we use the envelope modifier that we use the envelope modifier that we use the envelope modifier so let's get rid of all this craziness so let's get rid of all this craziness so let's get rid of all this craziness we're going to right click join areas we're going to right click join areas we're going to right click join areas here's our graph editor now what you here's our graph editor now what you here's our graph editor now what you want to do is Click N it'll pop open want to do is Click N it'll pop open want to do is Click N it'll pop open this little side window and you can go this little side window and you can go this little side window and you can go over to the modifiers and we want to add over to the modifiers and we want to add over to the modifiers and we want to add in an envelope modifier so this allows in an envelope modifier so this allows in an envelope modifier so this allows you to change around these lines you to change around these lines you to change around these lines so we can click add control point right so we can click add control point right so we can click add control point right here at the very beginning and now from here at the very beginning and now from here at the very beginning and now from here you can take the reference this here you can take the reference this here you can take the reference this essentially moves the entire thing up essentially moves the entire thing up essentially moves the entire thing up and down you can take the Min and the and down you can take the Min and the and down you can take the Min and the max which I'm not going to confuse you max which I'm not going to confuse you max which I'm not going to confuse you guys at first let's just talk about guys at first let's just talk about guys at first let's just talk about reference so add control point I'm going reference so add control point I'm going reference so add control point I'm going to take the reference and just move it to take the reference and just move it to take the reference and just move it so that the so that these Peaks are sort so that the so that these Peaks are sort so that the so that these Peaks are sort of like this so now instead of of like this so now instead of of like this so now instead of everything being above zero it's going everything being above zero it's going everything being above zero it's going to sometimes dip to zero sometimes go to to sometimes dip to zero sometimes go to to sometimes dip to zero sometimes go to one so you see this is zero this is one one so you see this is zero this is one one so you see this is zero this is one again this is your bottom line now right now we're not controlling the now right now we're not controlling the now right now we're not controlling the actual glow value we're still actual glow value we're still actual glow value we're still controlling just the factor of the color controlling just the factor of the color controlling just the factor of the color lamp so nothing's happening right now so lamp so nothing's happening right now so lamp so nothing's happening right now so we need to go back here we need to go back here we need to go back here let's go back to our Shader editor and let's go back to our Shader editor and let's go back to our Shader editor and this is only for controlling the flash this is only for controlling the flash this is only for controlling the flash you see this is zero one zero one so you see this is zero one zero one so you see this is zero one zero one so this is controlling the flashing or the this is controlling the flashing or the this is controlling the flashing or the power the strength of the emission power the strength of the emission power the strength of the emission we're going to do the same thing just go we're going to do the same thing just go we're going to do the same thing just go to on your timeline the beginning to on your timeline the beginning to on your timeline the beginning and then Shader editor hover over click and then Shader editor hover over click and then Shader editor hover over click I to set your keyframe I to set your keyframe I to set your keyframe so back in our graph editor so back in our graph editor so back in our graph editor now you can see we have the emission now you can see we have the emission now you can see we have the emission strength that's what we want to be strength that's what we want to be strength that's what we want to be working with let's sync it to the music working with let's sync it to the music working with let's sync it to the music so key big sound F curves and load in so key big sound F curves and load in so key big sound F curves and load in our sound file our sound file our sound file so let's do that exact same thing so let's do that exact same thing so let's do that exact same thing add in an envelope modifier control add in an envelope modifier control add in an envelope modifier control point so we can move it and then point so we can move it and then point so we can move it and then reference reference reference and there we go let's take a look at and there we go let's take a look at and there we go let's take a look at what it's given us what it's given us what it's given us [Music] [Music] [Music] so we're starting to get that where it's so we're starting to get that where it's so we're starting to get that where it's sort of starting it's starting out at sort of starting it's starting out at sort of starting it's starting out at zero completely blacked out and it's zero completely blacked out and it's zero completely blacked out and it's bumping up and Fading Into the color bumping up and Fading Into the color bumping up and Fading Into the color it's just not bright enough now there's it's just not bright enough now there's it's just not bright enough now there's two ways you could go about changing two ways you could go about changing two ways you could go about changing this you guys can either change the Min this you guys can either change the Min this you guys can either change the Min and Max values here and Max values here and Max values here to kind make these Peaks larger or an to kind make these Peaks larger or an to kind make these Peaks larger or an easier way is to just go back to the easier way is to just go back to the easier way is to just go back to the Shader editor and what we can do is just Shader editor and what we can do is just Shader editor and what we can do is just amplify this using something like a math amplify this using something like a math amplify this using something like a math node so we'll take the strength here node so we'll take the strength here node so we'll take the strength here just click and drag out a wire and just click and drag out a wire and just click and drag out a wire and search for math we're going to want to search for math we're going to want to search for math we're going to want to change this from add to multiply so now change this from add to multiply so now change this from add to multiply so now essentially what it's going to do essentially what it's going to do essentially what it's going to do it's going to take the beginning value it's going to take the beginning value it's going to take the beginning value here which is what we're going to here which is what we're going to here which is what we're going to keyframe and it's going to multiply it keyframe and it's going to multiply it keyframe and it's going to multiply it by whatever this value is here so if by whatever this value is here so if by whatever this value is here so if this is our standard we can set this to this is our standard we can set this to this is our standard we can set this to something like 10 something like 10 something like 10 and then we can do the same thing we can and then we can do the same thing we can and then we can do the same thing we can click I to keyframe this value and Link click I to keyframe this value and Link click I to keyframe this value and Link that up with our music that up with our music that up with our music so back to our graph editor again if so back to our graph editor again if so back to our graph editor again if you're not seeing that on check here you're not seeing that on check here you're not seeing that on check here and here it is so here's the math value and here it is so here's the math value and here it is so here's the math value big sound F curves load that in big sound F curves load that in big sound F curves load that in [Music] [Music] [Music] the things are a lot brighter as we go the things are a lot brighter as we go the things are a lot brighter as we go through and even when we go in add in through and even when we go in add in through and even when we go in add in the envelope like we did before the envelope like we did before the envelope like we did before that reference so we get the flash that reference so we get the flash that reference so we get the flash now we can control the brightness at the now we can control the brightness at the now we can control the brightness at the maximum Peak for this part so if we just maximum Peak for this part so if we just maximum Peak for this part so if we just open up so again open up so again open up so again Shader editor if this isn't bright Shader editor if this isn't bright Shader editor if this isn't bright enough for you just crank up that value enough for you just crank up that value enough for you just crank up that value 25 whatever you want 25 whatever you want 25 whatever you want and now as you guys see we have that and now as you guys see we have that and now as you guys see we have that flashing in and out flashing in and out flashing in and out that we're looking for it really makes that we're looking for it really makes that we're looking for it really makes it come alive when it comes to reacting it come alive when it comes to reacting it come alive when it comes to reacting play for you guys and especially in the B traps and especially in the B traps and especially in the B traps now you're gonna see there's one issue now you're gonna see there's one issue now you're gonna see there's one issue here and that is whenever it does get to here and that is whenever it does get to here and that is whenever it does get to those High values for the B trap it's those High values for the B trap it's those High values for the B trap it's going so far away from this line that going so far away from this line that going so far away from this line that it's no longer dipping in and out and it's no longer dipping in and out and it's no longer dipping in and out and again if it's not dipping below this again if it's not dipping below this again if it's not dipping below this blue line This zero line it's not going blue line This zero line it's not going blue line This zero line it's not going to be flashing from zero into one so to be flashing from zero into one so to be flashing from zero into one so again this is below the line so it's again this is below the line so it's again this is below the line so it's black this is above so it's colored so black this is above so it's colored so black this is above so it's colored so it needs to always be dipping below and it needs to always be dipping below and it needs to always be dipping below and above that line so if you want the parts above that line so if you want the parts above that line so if you want the parts with the B drop obviously it's louder so with the B drop obviously it's louder so with the B drop obviously it's louder so the beat so every all these are going to the beat so every all these are going to the beat so every all these are going to be up here be up here be up here you need to do that same thing with you need to do that same thing with you need to do that same thing with reference and to do that without messing reference and to do that without messing reference and to do that without messing up anything you've done here you need to up anything you've done here you need to up anything you've done here you need to add another envelope so what we do is we add another envelope so what we do is we add another envelope so what we do is we take our first envelope and you're going take our first envelope and you're going take our first envelope and you're going to see this restrict frame range to see this restrict frame range to see this restrict frame range check that on we want this to stop right check that on we want this to stop right check that on we want this to stop right around here 6 30. there we go now around here 6 30. there we go now around here 6 30. there we go now whenever it comes to our beat drop let's whenever it comes to our beat drop let's whenever it comes to our beat drop let's go ahead and just copy this and then go ahead and just copy this and then go ahead and just copy this and then paste it paste it paste it and then we'll just change around the and then we'll just change around the and then we'll just change around the restrict

end or ever maybe like around and then end or ever maybe like around 1000 or 950 and then all you do is take 1000 or 950 and then all you do is take 1000 or 950 and then all you do is take the reference and you lower it the reference and you lower it the reference and you lower it foreign foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] so pretty cool I think that the flashing so pretty cool I think that the flashing so pretty cool I think that the flashing in and out just gives it just makes it in and out just gives it just makes it in and out just gives it just makes it feel a lot more alive again here's the feel a lot more alive again here's the feel a lot more alive again here's the difference this is without the flashing difference this is without the flashing difference this is without the flashing in and out in and out in and out [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's just our color this is with so that's just our color this is with so that's just our color this is with the

so let's let's talk about that all right so let's let's talk about that all right so let's add in something new here we're going to add in something new here we're going to add in something new here we're going to go to file import I'm going to bring in go to file import I'm going to bring in go to file import I'm going to bring in another object from my music video pack another object from my music video pack another object from my music video pack same pack where I got this head bus you same pack where I got this head bus you same pack where I got this head bus you can find that on my website if you're can find that on my website if you're can find that on my website if you're interested got a little tunnel piece interested got a little tunnel piece interested got a little tunnel

internet that you guys can find on the internet turbo squid whatever now what I'm going turbo squid whatever now what I'm going turbo squid whatever now what I'm going to do is just extend this tunnel and we to do is just extend this tunnel and we to do is just extend this tunnel and we can do that very easily by going to our can do that very easily by going to our can do that very easily by going to our modifiers and adding in an array modifiers and adding in an array modifiers and adding in an array modifier so right now it is going across modifier so right now it is going across modifier so right now it is going across the x-axis this count is going to add in the x-axis this count is going to add in the x-axis this count is going to add in how many you'd like so let's go and how many you'd like so let's go and how many you'd like so let's go and change this we want it to go on the change this we want it to go on the change this we want it to go on the z-axis z-axis z-axis but Z to negative one okay and now we but Z to negative one okay and now we but Z to negative one okay and now we just need to get rid of this gapping so just need to get rid of this gapping so just need to get rid of this gapping so we'll open up the constant offset we'll open up the constant offset we'll open up the constant offset and we'll just move over the Z and that and we'll just move over the Z and that and we'll just move over the Z and that looks fine so now every time we bump up looks fine so now every time we bump up looks fine so now every time we bump up the counts it's going to keep extending the counts it's going to keep extending the counts it's going to keep extending out this tunnel and also be aware here out this tunnel and also be aware here out this tunnel and also be aware here the more you do this the more computer the more you do this the more computer the more you do this the more computer intensive it is 10 is fine but if you're intensive it is 10 is fine but if you're intensive it is 10 is fine but if you're going for like 1 000 things could get a going for like 1 000 things could get a going for like 1 000 things could get a little bit laggy but this should work little bit laggy but this should work little bit laggy but this should work for us now before we do anything crazy for us now before we do anything crazy for us now before we do anything

have a very different so we're gonna have a very different so we're gonna have a very different line here instead of going horizontally line here instead of going horizontally line here instead of going horizontally here it's going to be more of a vertical here it's going to be more of a vertical here it's going to be more of a vertical curve as you see because we link this up with as you see because we link this up with as you see because we link this up with the Y location the Y location the Y location the higher this value the more the Y is the higher this value the more the Y is the higher this value the more the Y is going to be pushed back so pay attention going to be pushed back so pay attention going to be pushed back so pay attention to the Y right here this is 16. to the Y right here this is 16. to the Y right here this is 16. [Applause] and you see the louder the music is the and you see the louder the music is the and you see the louder the music is the more it pushes it back so if we go to more it pushes it back so if we go to more it pushes it back so if we go to where the beat drop is you're going to where the beat drop is you're going to where the beat drop is you're going to see this is going to shove all the way see this is going to shove all the way see this is going to shove all the way back now right now it's going in the wrong now right now it's going in the wrong now right now it's going in the wrong direction so let's add an envelope and direction so let's add an envelope and direction so let's add an envelope and we're going to add a control point and we're going to add a control point and we're going to add a control point and we're just going to invert this so we're just going to invert this so we're just going to invert this so instead of the minimum being negative instead of the minimum being negative instead of the minimum being negative one maximum being one we're going to put one maximum being one we're going to put one maximum being one we're going to put this at one and this at negative one this at one and this at negative one this at one and this at negative one so now you see it's moving towards the so now you see it's moving towards the so now you see it's moving towards the camera and you can control if you'd like camera and you can control if you'd like camera and you can control if you'd like the power of this so how fast this is the power of this so how fast this

by taking this value on the right here by taking this value on the right here so this is our maximum just making that so this is our maximum just making that so this is our maximum just making that a lot more steep so you see I'm a lot more steep so you see I'm a lot more steep so you see I'm controlling the steepness we don't want controlling the steepness we don't want controlling the steepness we don't want this to pop back up like that we want to this to pop back up like that we want to this to pop back up like that we want to control and make it a steep line so now you guys are going to see it's so now you guys are going to see it's so now you guys are going to see it's moving a lot faster on the y-axis moving a lot faster on the y-axis moving a lot faster on the y-axis because we Crank that up and once we get because we Crank that up and once we get because we Crank that up and once we get to our B trap this is just going to fly to our B trap this is just going to fly to our B

from here first off what you guys can do from here first off you can do this to any other value so if you can do this to any other value so if you can do this to any other value so if you want y rotation you want y rotation you want y rotation you can do that just make sure your you can do that just make sure your you can do that just make sure your origin is set correctly origin is set correctly origin is set correctly that's the origin is where your rotate that's the origin is where your rotate that's the origin is where your rotate Center Point is going to be so right now Center

little orange dot we can go up to object little orange dot we can go up to object little orange dot we can go up to object origin to Geometry origin to Geometry origin to Geometry now that's more in the center so we can now that's more in the center so we can now that's more in the center so we can test with our y rotation looking good test with our y rotation looking good test with our y rotation looking good and you can do the exact same thing so and you can do the exact same thing so and you can do the exact same thing so click I on your y now you're going to click I on your y now you're going to click I on your y now you're going to see all those rotation values and you see all those rotation values and you see all those rotation values and you can just key can just key can just key big sound F curves big sound F curves big sound F curves keep the additive on there you go you keep the additive on there you go you keep the additive on there you go you can even copy and paste the modifier so can even copy and paste the modifier so can even copy and paste the modifier so let's just click here copy it and paste let's just click here copy it and paste let's just click here copy it and paste the envelope that we already worked on the envelope that we already worked on the envelope that we already worked on and you can see a little bit too crazy and you can see a little bit too crazy and you can see a little bit too crazy with the maximum but this is a good with the maximum but this is a good with the maximum but this is a good visualization of controlling the visualization of controlling the visualization of controlling the velocity with the audio velocity with the audio velocity with the audio [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] we don't want this to be 10 let's maybe we don't want this to be 10 let's maybe we don't want this to be 10 let's maybe set this to one if that's still too much again with Spin if that's still too much again with Spin if that's still too much again with Spin and maybe you may want to downplay it so and maybe you may want to downplay it so and maybe you may want to downplay it so you don't get nauseated you don't get nauseated you don't get nauseated [Music] [Music] [Music] you see what I mean we can link it to you see what I mean we can link it to you see what I mean we can link it to the spin we can link it to

I'd like to show you now the final thing I'd like to show you now the final thing I'd like to show you is frequency control so let's go shift a is frequency control so let's go shift a is frequency control so let's go shift a here and we'll add in an icosphere and here and we'll add in an icosphere and here and we'll add in an icosphere and let's move this over so if you want this let's move this over so if you want this let's move this over so if you want this to only react to certain frequencies for to only react to certain frequencies for to only react to certain frequencies for example the base of a song which you example the base of a song which you example the base of a song which you guys can do first of all let's make this guys can do first of all let's make this guys can do first of all let's make this sort of like audio reactor visualizory sort of like audio reactor visualizory sort of like audio reactor visualizory by adding in some modifiers so we're by adding in some modifiers so we're by adding in some modifiers so we're going to add in first of all a displace going to add in first of all a displace going to add in first of all a displace and from the displays here you can see and from the displays here you can see and from the displays here you can see the more you crank the value the more the more you crank the value the more the more you crank the value the more this changes and the shape that it this changes and the shape that it this changes and the shape that it changes is going to be dependent on this changes is going to be dependent on this changes is going to be dependent on this texture so you can click new to create a texture so you can click new to create a texture so you can click new to create a new texture new texture new texture we'll go to the texture tab here texture we'll go to the texture tab here texture we'll go to the texture tab here texture properties and then you can choose the properties and then you can choose the properties and then you can choose the type so there's clouds you know there's type so there's clouds you know there's type so there's clouds you know there's a bunch of different little presets here a bunch of different little presets here a bunch of different little presets here for the pattern you can add a for the pattern you can add a for the pattern you can add a subdivision surface you can apply these subdivision surface you can apply these subdivision surface you can apply these you're not a wireframe if you wanted to you're not a wireframe if you wanted to you're not a wireframe if you wanted to get all crazy organic style and then we get all crazy organic style and then we get all crazy organic style and then we do the same that we've been doing to do the same that we've been doing to do the same that we've been doing to sync it to the music so we'll take the sync it to the music so we'll take the sync it to the music so we'll take the strength of our displace click I to strength of our displace click I to strength of our displace click I to insert that keyframe and you should now insert that keyframe and you should now insert that keyframe and you should now see it in your graph editor bake sound F see it in your graph editor bake sound F see it in your graph editor bake sound F curves and this time we're going to take curves and this time we're going to take curves and this time we're going to take the highest frequency here so usually the highest frequency here so usually the highest frequency here so usually this is maxed out if you wanted to be this is maxed out if you wanted to be this is maxed out if you wanted to be around the Bassy range you want to go around the Bassy range you want to go around the Bassy range you want to go 250 or under so we'll click bake sound 250 or under so we'll click bake sound 250 or under so we'll click bake sound and now at the beginning when there's no and now at the beginning when there's no and now at the beginning when there's no hard bass you shouldn't see this moving hard bass you shouldn't see this moving hard bass you shouldn't see this moving that much you see everything's reacting that much you see everything's reacting that much you see everything's reacting there's still movement and velocity and there's still movement and velocity and there's still movement and velocity and everything else everything else everything else [Music] so yeah just some examples on how you so yeah just some examples on how you so yeah just some examples on how you can control audio how you can transform can control audio how you can transform can control audio how you can transform audio into motion or audio into color or audio into motion or audio into color or audio into motion or audio into color or into light flickering on and off there's into light flickering on and off there's into light flickering on and off there's a ton of different things you guys can a ton of different things you guys can a ton of different things you guys can do and when the whole name of the game do and when the whole name of the game do and when the whole name of the game is matching the visual to the audio it is matching the visual to the audio it is matching the visual to the audio it doesn't matter if you're making dubstep doesn't matter if you're making dubstep doesn't matter if you're making dubstep house music where you see a ton of this house music where you see a ton of this house music where you see a ton of this stuff or even a rap music video anytime stuff or even a rap music video anytime stuff or even a rap music video anytime you want to match the music with the you want to match the music with the you want to match the music with the visual use these tools and you can visual use these tools and you can visual use these tools and you can create some really amazing looking create some really amazing looking create some really amazing looking effects that really match the vibe that effects that really match the vibe that effects that really match the vibe that you're going for so that's about it guys you're going for so that's about it guys you're going for so that's about it guys the only bonus I would say is if there the only bonus I would say is if there the only bonus I would say is if there is a specific thing like a really big is a specific thing like a really big is a specific thing like a really big base hit or any other specific part of base hit or any other specific part of base hit or any other specific part of the song you can kind of make the song you can kind of make the song you can kind of make corresponding camera movements to match corresponding camera movements to match corresponding camera movements to match in with that so for example if I grab my in with that so for example if I grab my in with that so for example if I grab my camera here maybe there's a big base hit camera here maybe there's a big base hit camera here maybe there's a big base hit and you can see if there is because you and you can see if there is because you and you can see if there is because you can just look at your visualizer and can just look at your visualizer and can just look at your visualizer and keyframe here move to where there's that keyframe here move to where there's that keyframe here move to where there's that big base hit change around the value and there you go you have some cool and there you go you have some cool and there you go you have some cool little camera effects that match in with little camera effects that match in with little camera effects that match in with that audio and you guys can go back to that audio and you guys can go back to that audio and you guys can go back to your graph editor your graph editor your graph editor and here's those keyframes so I think and here's those keyframes so I think and here's those keyframes so I think mine was y rotation yep there it is you mine was y rotation yep there it is you mine was y rotation yep there it is you guys can click T and you can change guys can click T and you can change guys can click T and you can change these around to different sort of these around to different sort of these around to different sort of presets back bounce presets back bounce presets back bounce elastic so yeah you have some options elastic so yeah you have some options elastic so yeah you have some options for some cool things you can do in for some cool things you can do in for some cool things you can do in camera as well and that really will give camera as well and that really will give camera as well and that really will give you like the cherry on top whenever you like the cherry on top whenever you like the cherry on top whenever you're making these visualizers you can you're making these visualizers you can you're making these visualizers you can do the same with zooming in so right do the same with zooming in so right do the same with zooming in so right here see there's a big hit we'll take here see there's a big hit we'll take here see there's a big hit we'll take our location y our location y our location y keyframe it and find that in the graph keyframe it and find that in the graph keyframe it and find that in the graph editor so here we go location y here's editor so here we go location y here's editor so here we go location y here's the keyframe the keyframe the keyframe this is where the bump is so we're going this is where the bump is so we're going this is where the bump is so we're going to want to Crank That forward keyframe keyframe keyframe move a bit and then you can just control move a bit and then you can just control move a bit and then you can just control C control V to paste that keyframe so C control V to paste that keyframe so C control V to paste that keyframe so you see we've created a little camera you see we've created a little camera you see we've created a little camera bump that's what it looks like just kind bump that's what it looks like just kind bump that's what it looks like just kind of emphasizes that a bit more and again of emphasizes that a bit more and again of emphasizes that a bit more and again that's why I say this is the cherry on that's why I say this is the cherry on that's why I say this is the cherry on top and then you can select those top and then you can select those top and then you can select those keyframes click T and then give it any keyframes click T and then give it any keyframes click T and then give it any sort of dynamic effect or interpolation sort of dynamic effect or interpolation sort of dynamic effect or interpolation you know all right guys so that's about you know all right guys so that's about you know all right guys so that's about it thank you so much for watching let me it thank you so much for watching let me it thank you so much for watching let me know in the comments down below anything know in the comments
