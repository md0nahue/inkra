Kind: captions Language: en so first instead of doing the advanced so first instead of doing the advanced so first instead of doing the advanced part first part first part first first we're going to first we're going to first we're going to animate this cube animate this cube animate this cube to an audio to an audio to an audio so we're going to switch to so we're going to switch to so we're going to switch to the graph editor the graph editor the graph editor and insert a keyframe the keyframe doesn't matter it's going the keyframe doesn't matter it's going the keyframe doesn't matter it's going to get overwritten to get overwritten to get overwritten in the graph editor in the graph editor in the graph editor select key select key select key big sound to f curves big sound to f curves big sound to f curves and the settings are over here on the and the settings are over here on the and the settings are over here on the left but you really don't need to left but you really don't need to left but you really don't need to to change them so so so you can see that you can see that you can see that this value this value this value the x y and z location the x y and z location the x y and z location are now are now are now animated to the volume of that sound animated to the volume of that sound animated to the volume of that sound clip and you can you can you can actually add in the sound clip so you actually add in the sound clip so you actually add in the sound clip so you hear what's going on [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's pretty simple you can you can so that's pretty simple you can you can so that's pretty simple you can you can animate some things this way animate some things this way animate some things this way um um um but what's important is but what's important is but what's important is about this tutorial is actually about this tutorial is actually about this tutorial is actually applying it to complex things like an applying it to complex things like an applying it to complex things like an armature an armature isn't going to work armature an armature isn't going to work armature an armature isn't going to work like this and and and other things and you also other things and you also other things and you also don't have control unless you make it don't have control unless you make it don't have control unless you make it all over again [Music] [Music] [Music] so so so i'm going to show you how to do it with i'm going to show you how to do it with i'm going to show you how to do it with drivers so we're going to leave this drivers so we're going to leave this drivers so we're going to leave this cube here this is going to be our cube here this is going to be our cube here this is going to be our control object so this is just going to be a different so this is just going to be a different so this is just going to be a different object just just just for something else to use for something else to use for something else to use this one this one this one i'm going to i'm going to i'm going to add a driver add a driver add a driver to the scale to the scale to the scale the z scale the z scale the z scale so so so how to how you add a driver is any value how to how you add a driver is any value how to how you add a driver is any value really anywhere in blender really anywhere in blender really anywhere in blender you right click on um the slider and add you right click on um the slider and add you right click on um the slider and add a driver if i click add drivers it's a driver if i click add drivers it's a driver if i click add drivers it's going to add drivers to the whole scale going to add drivers to the whole scale going to add drivers to the whole scale but i'm just going to add a single but i'm just going to add a single but i'm just going to add a single driver driver driver and and and back in the graph editor switch to back in the graph editor switch to back in the graph editor switch to drivers drivers drivers and um and um and um all the drivers for this object there's all the drivers for this object there's all the drivers for this object there's only one are over here only one are over here only one are over here so you can only select and edit one at a so you can only select and edit one at a so you can only select and edit one at a time let's see you're going to scroll down to the you're going to scroll down to the you're going to scroll down to the drivers section drivers section drivers section and this is a little complicated but and this is a little complicated but and this is a little complicated but i'll explain it um i'll explain it um i'll explain it um this in the expression box this in the expression box this in the expression box this is the value of whatever this is the value of whatever this is the value of whatever z scale is z scale is z scale is or whatever value you're changing so or whatever value you're changing so or whatever value you're changing so it's at one it's going to stay at one um it's at one it's going to stay at one um it's at one it's going to stay at one um you could type in five and it's going to you could type in five and it's going to you could type in five and it's going to stay at five stay at five stay at five um um um but what we're going to do but what we're going to do but what we're going to do is use this down here this is is use this down here this is is use this down here this is an external value uh named var an external value uh named var an external value uh named var um um um and we have to actually choose and we have to actually choose and we have to actually choose where to get that value from we're going where to get that value from we're going where to get that value from we're going to get it from to get it from to get it from cube cube cube that cube we made earlier and we're that cube we made earlier and we're that cube we made earlier and we're going to get it from the cube's x going to get it from the cube's x going to get it from the cube's x location and that's going to be called location and that's going to be called location and that's going to be called var so we type in var and and and this this this is going to constantly be is going to constantly be is going to constantly be this value is going to constantly be this value is going to constantly be this value is going to constantly be this other objects [Music] [Music] [Music] but we want to actually be able to edit but we want to actually be able to edit but we want to actually be able to edit it it it so so so this this this this box right here this box right here this box right here acts um you can put in any mathematical acts um you can put in any mathematical acts um you can put in any mathematical equation so let's say we don't want it equation so let's say we don't want it equation so let's say we don't want it to be flat when the value is at zero so to be flat when the value is at zero so to be flat when the value is at zero so var plus two var plus two var plus two this is going to take whatever value this is going to take whatever value this is going to take whatever value it's at and add two it's at and add two it's at and add two [Music] [Music] [Music] the asterisk is multiplied the asterisk is multiplied the asterisk is multiplied [Music] [Music] um um um we can we can we can apply this to just about anything apply this to just about anything apply this to just about anything so let's add a driver to let's add a driver to let's add a driver to this and make it change color to add a driver to a color you just have to add a driver to a color you just have to add a driver to a color you just have to right click on that box so now we have these three drivers and so now we have these three drivers and so now we have these three drivers and i'm going to switch the red switch the red switch the red and for for each one you have to select and for for each one you have to select and for for each one you have to select this cube again this cube again this cube again i usually name it something that's going i usually name it something that's going i usually name it something that's going to be at the top of the list for a big to be at the top of the list for a big to be at the top of the list for a big scene scene scene and put in bar and now and now and now [Music] that's changing color um and that's the that's changing color um and that's the that's changing color um and that's the red red red changing changing changing amount but since the other since the amount but since the other since the amount but since the other since the other values other values other values you can see at this particular frame you can see at this particular frame you can see at this particular frame the red is down to zero to almost zero the red is down to zero to almost zero the red is down to zero to almost zero because the sound is at almost zero because the sound is at almost zero because the sound is at almost zero um and the other colors are still up so um and the other colors are still up so um and the other colors are still up so um um um have fun trying to make that work um and then for armatures let's add an armature let's just let's just let's just add a little something add a little something add a little something that we can deform this with and i'm going to i'm going to add a new and i'm going to i'm going to add a new and i'm going to i'm going to add a new bone and use it as a an ik target an ik target an ik target so i can do that to it that's not exactly i can do that to it that's not exactly i can do that to it that's not exactly what i wanted oh right what i wanted oh right what i wanted oh right i have to split this up so that i can i have to split this up so that i can i have to split this up so that i can actually animate it so that's a little weird but so that's a little weird but so that's a little weird but um um um just like everything else you can add drivers and you can add individual add drivers and you can add individual add drivers and you can add individual drivers drivers drivers and if i wanted to i could and if i wanted to i could and if i wanted to i could control the control the control the x location x location x location with one controller with one controller with one controller so you had multiple so you had multiple so you had multiple targets targets targets and they each and they each and they each were based on a different audio file say were based on a different audio file say were based on a different audio file say one was the high-pitched part of the one was the high-pitched part of the one was the high-pitched part of the audio file one was the baseline audio file one was the baseline audio file one was the baseline etc etc etc you could you could you could affect individual things affect individual things affect individual things uh the x location with the baseline y uh the x location with the baseline y uh the x location with the baseline y with the with the with the um um um the high pitched notes and the high pitched notes and the high pitched notes and you can also you can also you can also um um um have have have multiple multiple multiple variables involved in this equation up variables involved in this equation up variables involved in this equation up here here here as well as well as well so you can you can do a lot of things so you can you can do a lot of things so you can you can do a lot of things you can get really complex and control you can get really complex and control you can get really complex and control things things things with this
