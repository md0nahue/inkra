Kind: captions Language: en [Music] [Music] [Music] so I've just opened blender and the so I've just opened blender and the so I've just opened blender and the default 3D viewport layout I'm going to default 3D viewport layout I'm going to default 3D viewport layout I'm going to click and drag to select everything and click and drag to select everything and click and drag to select everything and press X to delete it and right away I'm press X to delete it and right away I'm press X to delete it and right away I'm going to hop over to my geometry nodes going to hop over to my geometry nodes going to hop over to my geometry nodes workspace and I'm not going to exit out workspace and I'm not going to exit out workspace and I'm not going to exit out of this left window yet I'm going to of this left window yet I'm going to of this left window yet I'm going to change it over to my video sequencer change it over to my video sequencer change it over to my video sequencer we're going to be creating an audio we're going to be creating an audio we're going to be creating an audio visual so I want to add sound to this visual so I want to add sound to this visual so I want to add sound to this I'll make sure I'm at the first keyframe I'll make sure I'm at the first keyframe I'll make sure I'm at the first keyframe add sound and the default settings are add sound and the default settings are add sound and the default settings are just fine add a sound strip now if we just fine add a sound strip now if we just fine add a sound strip now if we zoom out on our timeline we can see how zoom out on our timeline we can see how zoom out on our timeline we can see how long our song is so when I zoom in I can long our song is so when I zoom in I can long our song is so when I zoom in I can see see see 3168 so I'm going to right click on this 3168 so I'm going to right click on this 3168 so I'm going to right click on this panel right here and create a horizontal panel right here and create a horizontal panel right here and create a horizontal split put my timeline in split put my timeline in split put my timeline in and then I can change the length of my and then I can change the length of my and then I can change the length of my animation to Executive three one six animation to Executive three one six animation to Executive three one six eight there we go it's as long as this eight there we go it's as long as this eight there we go it's as long as this on now I can close this window I'll on now I can close this window I'll on now I can close this window I'll right click right click right click join areas and X this one out so I've join areas and X this one out so I've join areas and X this one out so I've got the three panels we'll be using for got the three panels we'll be using for got the three panels we'll be using for our 3D model now and just to double our 3D model now and just to double our 3D model now and just to double check when you press play you should be check when you press play you should be check when you press play you should be able to hear the song there we go so to start off in our there we go so to start off in our there we go so to start off in our geometry node editor we need some geometry node editor we need some geometry node editor we need some geometry up in our 3D viewport I'm just geometry up in our 3D viewport I'm just geometry up in our 3D viewport I'm just going to add a plane now we can click going to add a plane now we can click going to add a plane now we can click new in our geometry nodes Editor to new in our geometry nodes Editor to new in our geometry nodes Editor to start modifying the plane and we start modifying the plane and we start modifying the plane and we actually don't want a plane we're going actually don't want a plane we're going actually don't want a plane we're going to want a cube and it's a curve so I'm to want a cube and it's a curve so I'm to want a cube and it's a curve so I'm going to delete that group input so that going to delete that group input so that going to delete that group input so that deleted our plane in our geometry nodes deleted our plane in our geometry nodes deleted our plane in our geometry nodes editor now we're going to be adding a editor now we're going to be adding a editor now we're going to be adding a mesh primitive Cube mesh primitive Cube mesh primitive Cube and place that the size I'm going to and place that the size I'm going to and place that the size I'm going to click and drag across all three and click and drag across all three and click and drag across all three and press 2 to scale it up to 2 meters and press 2 to scale it up to 2 meters and press 2 to scale it up to 2 meters and we can plug that into our geometry and we can plug that into our geometry and we can plug that into our geometry and now we've got our Cube now we've got our Cube now we've got our Cube 2 meters squared 2 meters squared 2 meters squared and then we're also going to be adding a and then we're also going to be adding a and then we're also going to be adding a circle so I shift a to search and you circle so I shift a to search and you circle so I shift a to search and you can tap s to search and type in can tap s to search and type in can tap s to search and type in Circle we'll want curved Circle what we Circle we'll want curved Circle what we Circle we'll want curved Circle what we want to do in this animation is instance want to do in this animation is instance want to do in this animation is instance the cube on the curve and animate the the cube on the curve and animate the the cube on the curve and animate the transformation as the cube moves around transformation as the cube moves around transformation as the cube moves around the curve so we're going to get an the curve so we're going to get an the curve so we're going to get an instance on points I'll shift a to instance on points I'll shift a to instance on points I'll shift a to search for instance and we don't want to search for instance and we don't want to search for instance and we don't want to instance our Cube we're going to be instance our Cube we're going to be instance our Cube we're going to be using the curve as the points and then using the curve as the points and then using the curve as the points and then our Cube will be our instance our Cube will be our instance our Cube will be our instance so now it's placed a cube along this so now it's placed a cube along this so now it's placed a cube along this curve that we've created and we can curve that we've created and we can curve that we've created and we can change the number of Cubes by the change the number of Cubes by the change the number of Cubes by the resolution of points on the curve down resolution of points on the curve down resolution of points on the curve down to only three cubes and upwards of a to only three cubes and upwards of a to only three cubes and upwards of a hundred and the size of this entire hundred and the size of this entire hundred and the size of this entire circle with the radius so now you can circle with the radius so now you can circle with the radius so now you can see that Circle next we want to give our see that Circle next we want to give our see that Circle next we want to give our Cube more geometry and more vertices so Cube more geometry and more vertices so Cube more geometry and more vertices so that it can deform to the music so we're that it can deform to the music so we're that it can deform to the music so we're going to add a subdivision surface going to add a subdivision surface going to add a subdivision surface and increase the levels to four for now and increase the levels to four for now and increase the levels to four for now now we want what we want to do is Orient now we want what we want to do is Orient now we want what we want to do is Orient the mesh so that they all would be the mesh so that they all would be the mesh so that they all would be scaling radially if I looked down at scaling radially if I looked down at scaling radially if I looked down at this we want it to be like rays of the this we want it to be like rays of the this we want it to be like rays of the Sun not like parallel lines so we can do Sun not like parallel lines so we can do Sun not like parallel lines so we can do that by aligning the Euler to Vector the that by aligning the Euler to Vector the that by aligning the Euler to Vector the data search for a line and I'm going to data search for a line and I'm going to data search for a line and I'm going to place it down to the side here and use place it down to the side here and use place it down to the side here and use it as the rotation for my instance it as the rotation for my instance it as the rotation for my instance and align it to the Y and then as the and align it to the Y and then as the and align it to the Y and then as the vector we want to use our current a vector we want to use our current a vector we want to use our current a search for a curve tangent search for a curve tangent search for a curve tangent by the tangent or vector so now based on by the tangent or vector so now based on by the tangent or vector so now based on our Factor we can control our Factor we can control our Factor we can control the orientation of these pieces and if the orientation of these pieces and if the orientation of these pieces and if we change the axis obviously the axis of we change the axis obviously the axis of we change the axis obviously the axis of rotation so this is exactly what we want rotation so this is exactly what we want rotation so this is exactly what we want it's radial like this uh when I increase it's radial like this uh when I increase it's radial like this uh when I increase the factor to one so now we want to the factor to one so now we want to the factor to one so now we want to animate the rotation of these objects animate the rotation of these objects animate the rotation of these objects about the curve over time so we'll use a about the curve over time so we'll use a about the curve over time so we'll use a scene time node to animate our curve scene time node to animate our curve scene time node to animate our curve with the gmath nodes with the gmath nodes with the gmath nodes so scene time and this will give us the so scene time and this will give us the so scene time and this will give us the seconds and animate our geometry seconds and animate our geometry seconds and animate our geometry modifier over time modifier over time modifier over time and what we're going to be animating and what we're going to be animating and what we're going to be animating with this is the rotation of our with this is the rotation of our with this is the rotation of our instance so search notation instance so search notation instance so search notation rotate instances and I'll be placing rotate instances and I'll be placing rotate instances and I'll be placing that after our instance on points and that after our instance on points and that after our instance on points and then our scene time will be plugged into then our scene time will be plugged into then our scene time will be plugged into our rotation so if I press play you'll our rotation so if I press play you'll our rotation so if I press play you'll see it rotate over time so obviously that's not the music that's so obviously that's not the music that's so obviously that's not the music that's just a Content modification of the just a Content modification of the just a Content modification of the geometry rotation over time it's really geometry rotation over time it's really geometry rotation over time it's really cool is using math you can really modify cool is using math you can really modify cool is using math you can really modify how this rotation appears so if we add a how this rotation appears so if we add a how this rotation appears so if we add a few math nodes few math nodes few math nodes change this to multiply and maybe even change this to multiply and maybe even change this to multiply and maybe even shift d duplicate it add this to divide shift d duplicate it add this to divide shift d duplicate it add this to divide press play press play press play you can see that slows it down if we you can see that slows it down if we you can see that slows it down if we multiply add we speed it up multiply add we speed it up multiply add we speed it up [Music] [Music] [Music] so you can do some really crazy stuff so you can do some really crazy stuff so you can do some really crazy stuff just with switching back and forth the just with switching back and forth the just with switching back and forth the speed of your rotation speed of your rotation speed of your rotation and then changing the value of what it's and then changing the value of what it's and then changing the value of what it's multiplying or dividing by so I'll just multiplying or dividing by so I'll just multiplying or dividing by so I'll just keep those at zero for now while we're keep those at zero for now while we're keep those at zero for now while we're working working working and what can make this really cool is and what can make this really cool is and what can make this really cool is also using an index to input your value also using an index to input your value also using an index to input your value so we can search for an index so we can search for an index so we can search for an index plug this into our value so then it changes the rate and the so then it changes the rate and the so then it changes the rate and the rotation of different objects throughout rotation of different objects throughout rotation of different objects throughout the entire animation makes it much more the entire animation makes it much more the entire animation makes it much more visually interesting and if you want go in and even add and if you want go in and even add and if you want go in and even add another math node in between here get another math node in between here get another math node in between here get really creative and before we get any farther remember and before we get any farther remember and before we get any farther remember to say we should have saved a lot sooner to say we should have saved a lot sooner to say we should have saved a lot sooner the last thing I want to do to modify the last thing I want to do to modify the last thing I want to do to modify the rotation is to add a combine x y z the rotation is to add a combine x y z the rotation is to add a combine x y z to be able to change the axis yet again to be able to change the axis yet again to be able to change the axis yet again that this is rotating around so this is that this is rotating around so this is that this is rotating around so this is now what we want we've isolated it on now what we want we've isolated it on now what we want we've isolated it on this x-axis here we can always change it this x-axis here we can always change it this x-axis here we can always change it to Y indexing staying radial and it's to Y indexing staying radial and it's to Y indexing staying radial and it's rotating exactly like we want and you rotating exactly like we want and you rotating exactly like we want and you can change the appearance of that by can change the appearance of that by can change the appearance of that by changing X or Y or even both changing X or Y or even both changing X or Y or even both and Y and Y and Y so one more step is to subdivide your so one more step is to subdivide your so one more step is to subdivide your Cube we want to add a subdivision Cube we want to add a subdivision Cube we want to add a subdivision surface surface surface to our Cube so it deforms and maybe take to our Cube so it deforms and maybe take to our Cube so it deforms and maybe take the levels up to four then we're going the levels up to four then we're going the levels up to four then we're going to be animating the size of our Cube and to be animating the size of our Cube and to be animating the size of our Cube and the rotation to the music so I'm going the rotation to the music so I'm going the rotation to the music so I'm going to use another combined x y z to use another combined x y z to use another combined x y z and then off my X Y and Z I'll just plug and then off my X Y and Z I'll just plug and then off my X Y and Z I'll just plug in a few values that I'll keep for in a few values that I'll keep for in a few values that I'll keep for making its value making its value making its value this will now be keyframe to the song this will now be keyframe to the song this will now be keyframe to the song I'll shift e to duplicate I'll shift e to duplicate I'll shift e to duplicate as this will and you can even plug this as this will and you can even plug this as this will and you can even plug this value into maybe X and then Y and Z so value into maybe X and then Y and Z so value into maybe X and then Y and Z so you can see it's zero right now you can see it's zero right now you can see it's zero right now so the transformation of these little so the transformation of these little so the transformation of these little objects will now happen to the music objects will now happen to the music objects will now happen to the music down here let's use a mix RGB to combine down here let's use a mix RGB to combine down here let's use a mix RGB to combine our music with the math as well and it's our music with the math as well and it's our music with the math as well and it's RGB and drop it into our scene time to RGB and drop it into our scene time to RGB and drop it into our scene time to combine it with the scene time that's combine it with the scene time that's combine it with the scene time that's already being implied and then we can already being implied and then we can already being implied and then we can plug in a value data search value into the second color so this mix will into the second color so this mix will into the second color so this mix will be combining depending on the factor the be combining depending on the factor the be combining depending on the factor the transformation of our rotation of our transformation of our rotation of our transformation of our rotation of our objects we'll see once it's moving so objects we'll see once it's moving so objects we'll see once it's moving so I'm going to press play and you'll see I'm going to press play and you'll see I'm going to press play and you'll see the movements of the objects and then as the movements of the objects and then as the movements of the objects and then as I change this factor and mix it with I change this factor and mix it with I change this factor and mix it with this other value the rotational change so when I increase and decrease this so when I increase and decrease this so when I increase and decrease this value it's being mixed with my scene value it's being mixed with my scene value it's being mixed with my scene time node depending on this factor I can time node depending on this factor I can time node depending on this factor I can reduce how much they're mixed and it reduce how much they're mixed and it reduce how much they're mixed and it only takes in color one or it can only takes in color one or it can only takes in color one or it can increase and it'll only take in color increase and it'll only take in color increase and it'll only take in color two two two that one more item I'm going to add is that one more item I'm going to add is that one more item I'm going to add is actually off of my combine x y z node actually off of my combine x y z node actually off of my combine x y z node I'm going to duplicate this value over I'm going to duplicate this value over I'm going to duplicate this value over here and then I'll plug it into my X here and then I'll plug it into my X here and then I'll plug it into my X now I'm going to use this value of my now I'm going to use this value of my now I'm going to use this value of my map map map plug it into my y That's the rotation plug it into my y That's the rotation plug it into my y That's the rotation effect that I'll be looking for and so effect that I'll be looking for and so effect that I'll be looking for and so far these are rotating exactly about our far these are rotating exactly about our far these are rotating exactly about our curve that we've created but to change curve that we've created but to change curve that we've created but to change your pivot point will really alter how your pivot point will really alter how your pivot point will really alter how this animation appears so if I click and this animation appears so if I click and this animation appears so if I click and drag on my X just slightly drag on my X just slightly drag on my X just slightly click and drag on my y I see now when click and drag on my y I see now when click and drag on my y I see now when you watch the objects rotate it's a lot you watch the objects rotate it's a lot you watch the objects rotate it's a lot more Wild remember we can always go back to our remember we can always go back to our remember we can always go back to our curve and increase the vertices count on curve and increase the vertices count on curve and increase the vertices count on our curve at the resolution so way more our curve at the resolution so way more our curve at the resolution so way more objects appear so with my resolution at objects appear so with my resolution at objects appear so with my resolution at something like a hundred you can see how something like a hundred you can see how something like a hundred you can see how cool that looks now and you can always cool that looks now and you can always cool that looks now and you can always change your radius of your overall change your radius of your overall change your radius of your overall sphere if you'd like now when we press sphere if you'd like now when we press sphere if you'd like now when we press play foreign or your ad or your device we're starting or your ad or your device we're starting or your ad or your device we're starting with the Divide let's start with the with the Divide let's start with the with the Divide let's start with the multiply so it's a lot faster multiply so it's a lot faster multiply so it's a lot faster just for a different effect change just for a different effect change just for a different effect change around your math nodes and then let's around your math nodes and then let's around your math nodes and then let's see see see [Music] [Music] [Music] and we get that Dynamic spiraling effect and we get that Dynamic spiraling effect and we get that Dynamic spiraling effect all that spiral changes throughout the all that spiral changes throughout the all that spiral changes throughout the animation because it's building off of animation because it's building off of animation because it's building off of the index that's why we inserted this the index that's why we inserted this the index that's why we inserted this index down here into the math and if you index down here into the math and if you index down here into the math and if you don't like that spiral you can change don't like that spiral you can change don't like that spiral you can change your offset point your offset point your offset point X and Y and then maybe change your X and Y and then maybe change your X and Y and then maybe change your subdivision or your resolution of your subdivision or your resolution of your subdivision or your resolution of your curve increase it a bunch I'm at 500 now all right there's our geometry node tree all right there's our geometry node tree all right there's our geometry node tree now let's get it animated to music so now let's get it animated to music so now let's get it animated to music so let's start from left to right I'm just let's start from left to right I'm just let's start from left to right I'm just going to go to this value select my going to go to this value select my going to go to this value select my geometry node object the value hit I geometry node object the value hit I geometry node object the value hit I and I need to go to Vertical split and and I need to go to Vertical split and and I need to go to Vertical split and go to My Graph editor so with all of those objects selected so with all of those objects selected so with all of those objects selected I'm at frame zero big sound to F curve T I'm at frame zero big sound to F curve T I'm at frame zero big sound to F curve T bakes on to F curve let's start with bakes on to F curve let's start with bakes on to F curve let's start with zero to 500 and reduce our attack time zero to 500 and reduce our attack time zero to 500 and reduce our attack time as far as we can big sound at the curves as far as we can big sound at the curves as far as we can big sound at the curves so there's our first step we've got that so there's our first step we've got that so there's our first step we've got that first value baked into our F curve and first value baked into our F curve and first value baked into our F curve and you can expand your geometry node object you can expand your geometry node object you can expand your geometry node object and click on that value then within our and click on that value then within our and click on that value then within our graph editors you see this tiny window graph editors you see this tiny window graph editors you see this tiny window over here modifiers so we can modify the over here modifiers so we can modify the over here modifiers so we can modify the f-curve with an envelope modifier f-curve with an envelope modifier f-curve with an envelope modifier if we add a control point you can click if we add a control point you can click if we add a control point you can click and drag to change the amount of noise and drag to change the amount of noise and drag to change the amount of noise in the curve more or less submit reduce in the curve more or less submit reduce in the curve more or less submit reduce it or make it much more chaotic so now it or make it much more chaotic so now it or make it much more chaotic so now this is finally a movement that's being this is finally a movement that's being this is finally a movement that's being mapped to Our Song throughout the entire mapped to Our Song throughout the entire mapped to Our Song throughout the entire song and you can see it's loud and then song and you can see it's loud and then song and you can see it's loud and then the song ends so that's the first the song ends so that's the first the song ends so that's the first movement that we've animated to our movement that we've animated to our movement that we've animated to our music music music if we give it a little test we can see if we give it a little test we can see if we give it a little test we can see so our object is flat right now because so our object is flat right now because so our object is flat right now because we're using the value of our x-axis we're using the value of our x-axis we're using the value of our x-axis basically at zero if we zoom in in our basically at zero if we zoom in in our basically at zero if we zoom in in our graph editor graph editor graph editor for way down at the minimal level 0.2 for way down at the minimal level 0.2 for way down at the minimal level 0.2 for scale and then it'll be up to almost for scale and then it'll be up to almost for scale and then it'll be up to almost five so this value will constantly five so this value will constantly five so this value will constantly change throughout the song change throughout the song change throughout the song [Music] there we go so the First Transformation there we go so the First Transformation there we go so the First Transformation of our little cube is happening so let's of our little cube is happening so let's of our little cube is happening so let's repeat that now for everywhere we placed repeat that now for everywhere we placed repeat that now for everywhere we placed a value so let's go back to keyframe 0 a value so let's go back to keyframe 0 a value so let's go back to keyframe 0 select this other value hovering over it select this other value hovering over it select this other value hovering over it and press I and press I and press I go to our graph editor key big sound to go to our graph editor key big sound to go to our graph editor key big sound to F curves and this time I'm going to go F curves and this time I'm going to go F curves and this time I'm going to go from a minimum of 500 to maximum of 1500 from a minimum of 500 to maximum of 1500 from a minimum of 500 to maximum of 1500 big sound to add curves so we can see big sound to add curves so we can see big sound to add curves so we can see it's a different frequency now that's it's a different frequency now that's it's a different frequency now that's affecting our object and it's actually affecting our object and it's actually affecting our object and it's actually at zero both of these values are at zero at zero both of these values are at zero at zero both of these values are at zero at the beginning of the song so our at the beginning of the song so our at the beginning of the song so our object disappeared as soon as I scrub object disappeared as soon as I scrub object disappeared as soon as I scrub forward in our timeline that's up little forward in our timeline that's up little forward in our timeline that's up little objects begin to pulse with the music so objects begin to pulse with the music so objects begin to pulse with the music so now we can transform it with X or the Y now we can transform it with X or the Y now we can transform it with X or the Y and Z axis independently and Z axis independently and Z axis independently let's add a modifier into this sound let's add a modifier into this sound let's add a modifier into this sound curve envelope modifier add a control curve envelope modifier add a control curve envelope modifier add a control point so now we can change how each of point so now we can change how each of point so now we can change how each of these how it responds on each of these these how it responds on each of these these how it responds on each of these axes so you can make it a flat disc by maxing so you can make it a flat disc by maxing so you can make it a flat disc by maxing it out in one direction or keep them it out in one direction or keep them it out in one direction or keep them pretty round all right we're getting pretty round all right we're getting pretty round all right we're getting there let's work our way down to our there let's work our way down to our there let's work our way down to our other value this one will be mixing with other value this one will be mixing with other value this one will be mixing with that overall rotation animation right that overall rotation animation right that overall rotation animation right keyframe zero value selected over over keyframe zero value selected over over keyframe zero value selected over over press I then graph editor key big sound press I then graph editor key big sound press I then graph editor key big sound to F curves to F curves to F curves and again let's make this respond to a and again let's make this respond to a and again let's make this respond to a different frequency from 1500 to 8 000. different frequency from 1500 to 8 000. different frequency from 1500 to 8 000. so this will actually be manipulating so this will actually be manipulating so this will actually be manipulating how the rotation happens such overall how the rotation happens such overall how the rotation happens such overall transformation of U and we can reduce transformation of U and we can reduce transformation of U and we can reduce that if it looks too crazy with our that if it looks too crazy with our that if it looks too crazy with our Factor so this mix will give us control Factor so this mix will give us control Factor so this mix will give us control of that so right now we're mostly just using our so right now we're mostly just using our so right now we're mostly just using our scene time to animate it it'll be a scene time to animate it it'll be a scene time to animate it it'll be a steady second by second count but if we steady second by second count but if we steady second by second count but if we increase our Factor it'll only be increase our Factor it'll only be increase our Factor it'll only be relying on the music for that value then relying on the music for that value then relying on the music for that value then so it'll go just back and forth if we so it'll go just back and forth if we so it'll go just back and forth if we have a factor of one and that isn't very cool so that's why and that isn't very cool so that's why and that isn't very cool so that's why we use this mix to reduce it slightly so we use this mix to reduce it slightly so we use this mix to reduce it slightly so it moves steadily throughout the entire it moves steadily throughout the entire it moves steadily throughout the entire video but you still see it react to the video but you still see it react to the video but you still see it react to the music and jiggle back and forth when the music and jiggle back and forth when the music and jiggle back and forth when the bass hits for example foreign so that's looking pretty sweet and you so that's looking pretty sweet and you so that's looking pretty sweet and you can see when we started zero we kept all can see when we started zero we kept all can see when we started zero we kept all those Transformations at the start of those Transformations at the start of those Transformations at the start of the song at zero so it's kind of cool the song at zero so it's kind of cool the song at zero so it's kind of cool that our curve starts at the single that our curve starts at the single that our curve starts at the single Circle and then building off of the Circle and then building off of the Circle and then building off of the index of the rotation and the scene time index of the rotation and the scene time index of the rotation and the scene time it actually changes throughout the it actually changes throughout the it actually changes throughout the entire animation it'll never be quite entire animation it'll never be quite entire animation it'll never be quite the same before we go let's add an the same before we go let's add an the same before we go let's add an envelope modifier did this F curve as envelope modifier did this F curve as envelope modifier did this F curve as well and you can see even by well and you can see even by well and you can see even by manipulating the envelope of going manipulating the envelope of going manipulating the envelope of going zero or not this can create a really zero or not this can create a really zero or not this can create a really cool effect I'll just keep it right cool effect I'll just keep it right cool effect I'll just keep it right there we're almost there one more value to we're almost there one more value to we're almost there one more value to keyframe let's go back to zero object keyframe let's go back to zero object keyframe let's go back to zero object value selected value selected value selected press I and open your graph editor the press I and open your graph editor the press I and open your graph editor the same thing the X sound to F curve one same thing the X sound to F curve one same thing the X sound to F curve one more let's go from eight thousand to more let's go from eight thousand to more let's go from eight thousand to fifteen thousand and this one of the big fifteen thousand and this one of the big fifteen thousand and this one of the big effects but if we use that envelope effects but if we use that envelope effects but if we use that envelope modifier and add our control point modifier and add our control point modifier and add our control point we can raise and lower this Min and max we can raise and lower this Min and max we can raise and lower this Min and max value so that F curve is more noisy so value so that F curve is more noisy so value so that F curve is more noisy so you can kind of see that the rotation you can kind of see that the rotation you can kind of see that the rotation and the speed that it's traveling around and the speed that it's traveling around and the speed that it's traveling around overall is reacting to the music just overall is reacting to the music just overall is reacting to the music just one more little detail that catches your one more little detail that catches your one more little detail that catches your eye eye eye foreign now we're ready to render this so all we now we're ready to render this so all we now we're ready to render this so all we need is a single material I'm going to need is a single material I'm going to need is a single material I'm going to get one more nose search for set get one more nose search for set get one more nose search for set material node and it's going to be super material node and it's going to be super material node and it's going to be super simple if we go over into our material simple if we go over into our material simple if we go over into our material properties and add a new material properties and add a new material properties and add a new material only thing I'm going to do is increase only thing I'm going to do is increase only thing I'm going to do is increase my metallic all the way up and if we go my metallic all the way up and if we go my metallic all the way up and if we go over to our rendered view I'm going to over to our rendered view I'm going to over to our rendered view I'm going to be using EV for this rendering we're be using EV for this rendering we're be using EV for this rendering we're going to need to change the background going to need to change the background going to need to change the background of our scene in our world properties of our scene in our world properties of our scene in our world properties other take my background to Black then other take my background to Black then other take my background to Black then I'm going to add a single light shift I'm going to add a single light shift I'm going to add a single light shift data search for an area light GE to grab data search for an area light GE to grab data search for an area light GE to grab scale it up and then increase the power scale it up and then increase the power scale it up and then increase the power of our light and our light properties to of our light and our light properties to of our light and our light properties to ten thousand so you can see it ten thousand so you can see it ten thousand so you can see it highlighting that little ring of objects highlighting that little ring of objects highlighting that little ring of objects now now we can grab our light and shift now now we can grab our light and shift now now we can grab our light and shift d to D duplicate R to rotate and I'll d to D duplicate R to rotate and I'll d to D duplicate R to rotate and I'll change the color this light make it change the color this light make it change the color this light make it something eye-catching like pink and I'm something eye-catching like pink and I'm something eye-catching like pink and I'm going to change the shape of both of going to change the shape of both of going to change the shape of both of these lights to a disk because you're these lights to a disk because you're these lights to a disk because you're going to be seeing these lights in the going to be seeing these lights in the going to be seeing these lights in the reflection I want them to be a disc reflection I want them to be a disc reflection I want them to be a disc shape you're totally not done yet you shape you're totally not done yet you shape you're totally not done yet you need to apply your material first there need to apply your material first there need to apply your material first there we go so now we've got our reflective we go so now we've got our reflective we go so now we've got our reflective material applied don't forget go back material applied don't forget go back material applied don't forget go back and tweak that speed of your Rotation by and tweak that speed of your Rotation by and tweak that speed of your Rotation by tweaking The Divide so now it'll happen tweaking The Divide so now it'll happen tweaking The Divide so now it'll happen a lot slower so this is kind of a cool effect that it so this is kind of a cool effect that it so this is kind of a cool effect that it like it starts as a circle and then over like it starts as a circle and then over like it starts as a circle and then over time it forms that spiral tortoise time it forms that spiral tortoise time it forms that spiral tortoise [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's why we used all this math and so that's why we used all this math and so that's why we used all this math and mixing with our scene time so we can mixing with our scene time so we can mixing with our scene time so we can create that cool effect of create that cool effect of create that cool effect of transformation starting as a single ring transformation starting as a single ring transformation starting as a single ring turning into this 3D Taurus and turning into this 3D Taurus and turning into this 3D Taurus and throughout the entire animation reacting throughout the entire animation reacting throughout the entire animation reacting to the music keep tweaking with this to the music keep tweaking with this to the music keep tweaking with this math and you'll create a cooler effect math and you'll create a cooler effect math and you'll create a cooler effect than I've been able to reach here now to than I've been able to reach here now to than I've been able to reach here now to render out our scene I'm going to use a render out our scene I'm going to use a render out our scene I'm going to use a two 3D viewports I'm going to change two 3D viewports I'm going to change two 3D viewports I'm going to change this to viewport pivot around and then this to viewport pivot around and then this to viewport pivot around and then I'll use this one for looking through my I'll use this one for looking through my I'll use this one for looking through my camera camera camera so I'm going to press one on the number so I'm going to press one on the number so I'm going to press one on the number pad to look exactly straight and shift 8 pad to look exactly straight and shift 8 pad to look exactly straight and shift 8 add a camera add a camera add a camera added that camera looking perfectly added that camera looking perfectly added that camera looking perfectly along the y-axis that was why I was along the y-axis that was why I was along the y-axis that was why I was looking straight but number one now in looking straight but number one now in looking straight but number one now in this view I'm going to press zero to this view I'm going to press zero to this view I'm going to press zero to look in my camera look in my camera look in my camera and and in my view panel I'm going to and and in my view panel I'm going to and and in my view panel I'm going to click camera to view so now we're click camera to view so now we're click camera to view so now we're controlling the location of our camera controlling the location of our camera controlling the location of our camera pivoting around and before you place it pivoting around and before you place it pivoting around and before you place it maybe scrub through your animation and maybe scrub through your animation and maybe scrub through your animation and see if you like that composition here we see if you like that composition here we see if you like that composition here we go and I'll press n in this view uncheck go and I'll press n in this view uncheck go and I'll press n in this view uncheck camera review and leave my camera in camera review and leave my camera in camera review and leave my camera in that spot that spot that spot so this will be my final rendered View so this will be my final rendered View so this will be my final rendered View and I think I actually want another and I think I actually want another and I think I actually want another light I'm going to shift the heat light I'm going to shift the heat light I'm going to shift the heat duplicate place it on the other side and duplicate place it on the other side and duplicate place it on the other side and rotate and make it a color that's a rotate and make it a color that's a rotate and make it a color that's a little bit opposite on the Spectrum so little bit opposite on the Spectrum so little bit opposite on the Spectrum so there's green on one side and some pink there's green on one side and some pink there's green on one side and some pink on the other now for our output on the other now for our output on the other now for our output properties I'm going to be using EV but properties I'm going to be using EV but properties I'm going to be using EV but I might turn up my rendering sample to I might turn up my rendering sample to I might turn up my rendering sample to something 900 and we'll go to our little something 900 and we'll go to our little something 900 and we'll go to our little printer icon and change the output printer icon and change the output printer icon and change the output location location location and we want to change our file format to and we want to change our file format to and we want to change our file format to FF and Peg video and you have a choice FF and Peg video and you have a choice FF and Peg video and you have a choice here if you expand your encoding you here if you expand your encoding you here if you expand your encoding you could stay with matroska and that's could stay with matroska and that's could stay with matroska and that's safest to export at MKV afterwards you safest to export at MKV afterwards you safest to export at MKV afterwards you need to re-mox your file to change the need to re-mox your file to change the need to re-mox your file to change the file format but mkvs can stop halfway file format but mkvs can stop halfway file format but mkvs can stop halfway through and the file is less prone to through and the file is less prone to through and the file is less prone to correcting or you can export straight to correcting or you can export straight to correcting or you can export straight to MP4 using this mpeg-4 encoding and then MP4 using this mpeg-4 encoding and then MP4 using this mpeg-4 encoding and then change your output quality to change your output quality to change your output quality to perceptually lossless and then you want perceptually lossless and then you want perceptually lossless and then you want to keep your audio in the video right to keep your audio in the video right to keep your audio in the video right now you have no audio so you need to now you have no audio so you need to now you have no audio so you need to select AAC and those settings are okay select AAC and those settings are okay select AAC and those settings are okay for audio channels for audio channels for audio channels heat on that stereo so now you're set to heat on that stereo so now you're set to heat on that stereo so now you're set to export you have your output location you export you have your output location you export you have your output location you could change your resolution to 4K for could change your resolution to 4K for could change your resolution to 4K for example example example 3840 by 2160 and this will output a 4K 3840 by 2160 and this will output a 4K 3840 by 2160 and this will output a 4K animation now but that'll just take more animation now but that'll just take more animation now but that'll just take more time for your computer so then I'll just time for your computer so then I'll just time for your computer so then I'll just go I'll save one more time before I go I'll save one more time before I go I'll save one more time before I click render always and then render click render always and then render click render always and then render animation [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]
