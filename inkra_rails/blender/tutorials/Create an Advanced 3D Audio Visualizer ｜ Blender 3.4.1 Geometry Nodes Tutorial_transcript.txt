Kind: captions Language: en so for today's tutorial we're going to so for today's tutorial we're going to so for today's tutorial we're going to be leveling up our audio visualizers be leveling up our audio visualizers be leveling up our audio visualizers using blender 3.4 okay so welcome back to the channel okay so welcome back to the channel okay so welcome back to the channel everyone uh it has been a while since we everyone uh it has been a while since we everyone uh it has been a while since we lasted an upload uh so happy New Year lasted an upload uh so happy New Year lasted an upload uh so happy New Year happy Christmas I hope you all had a happy Christmas I hope you all had a happy Christmas I hope you all had a really good festive period uh yes we are really good festive period uh yes we are really good festive period uh yes we are into February now but hey happy New Year into February now but hey happy New Year into February now but hey happy New Year okay so today we're going to be looking okay so today we're going to be looking okay so today we're going to be looking at uh building a really cool it's going at uh building a really cool it's going at uh building a really cool it's going to be simple but it's going to be quite to be simple but it's going to be quite to be simple but it's going to be quite a different take on the visualizer a different take on the visualizer a different take on the visualizer visualizers you may have seen uh through visualizers you may have seen uh through visualizers you may have seen uh through various tutorials will show you how to various tutorials will show you how to various tutorials will show you how to drop a track into the um graph editor drop a track into the um graph editor drop a track into the um graph editor and then that the animation take over and then that the animation take over and then that the animation take over from there so it does react to music but from there so it does react to music but from there so it does react to music but what we're going to do is something a what we're going to do is something a what we're going to do is something a little bit more scientific today so little bit more scientific today so little bit more scientific today so we're going to start off with blender we're going to start off with blender we're going to start off with blender 3.4.1 you should be okay with anything 3.4.1 you should be okay with anything 3.4.1 you should be okay with anything blender free onwards so don't worry blender free onwards so don't worry blender free onwards so don't worry about going to the latest anything with about going to the latest anything with about going to the latest anything with geometry nodes is fine we're also going geometry nodes is fine we're also going geometry nodes is fine we're also going to be operating in Eevee but uh you to be operating in Eevee but uh you to be operating in Eevee but uh you could do this in Cycles it's just a lot could do this in Cycles it's just a lot could do this in Cycles it's just a lot quicker and easy quicker and easy quicker and easy so the first thing we've got is our so the first thing we've got is our so the first thing we've got is our default Cube we're not going to delete default Cube we're not going to delete default Cube we're not going to delete it instead we're going to go into it instead we're going to go into it instead we're going to go into geometry nodes and we're going to delete geometry nodes and we're going to delete geometry nodes and we're going to delete the group input so I've not deleted the the group input so I've not deleted the the group input so I've not deleted the default Cube I've just changed this form default Cube I've just changed this form default Cube I've just changed this form and the first thing I'm going to do and the first thing I'm going to do and the first thing I'm going to do is we're going to put in a mesh Circle and there you go you can see your circle and there you go you can see your circle and there you go you can see your circle one meter for two vertices you can play one meter for two vertices you can play one meter for two vertices you can play around with these figures and we'll have around with these figures and we'll have around with these figures and we'll have a we'll have a look and see what happens a we'll have a look and see what happens a we'll have a look and see what happens when you do that later but what we're when you do that later but what we're when you do that later but what we're going to do now it's going to do an going to do now it's going to do an going to do now it's going to do an instance on point so we're interested in instance on point so we're interested in instance on point so we're interested in the points on this circle the points on this circle the points on this circle so instance uh so instance uh so instance uh points actually since it's on points points actually since it's on points points actually since it's on points plug in there and immediately disappears plug in there and immediately disappears plug in there and immediately disappears and what we want to do is we want to put and what we want to do is we want to put and what we want to do is we want to put something interesting something interesting something interesting in the in the in the instances and we're going to put cubes instances and we're going to put cubes instances and we're going to put cubes now you can now you can now you can play around with this put other things play around with this put other things play around with this put other things in here cylinders look quite cool as in here cylinders look quite cool as in here cylinders look quite cool as well so straight away we have one meter well so straight away we have one meter well so straight away we have one meter cubes only one meter ready so it looks cubes only one meter ready so it looks cubes only one meter ready so it looks densely passed so let's make this densely passed so let's make this densely passed so let's make this a little bit similar point one works a little bit similar point one works a little bit similar point one works quite nicely and what we have is a ring quite nicely and what we have is a ring quite nicely and what we have is a ring of of of um a ring of Cubes but we don't want um a ring of Cubes but we don't want um a ring of Cubes but we don't want them to point this way we're kind of them to point this way we're kind of them to point this way we're kind of light to have them normal so what we're light to have them normal so what we're light to have them normal so what we're going to do going to do going to do is we're going to have another is we're going to have another is we're going to have another control a we've got normals I'm going to tell the computers to do is I'm going to tell the computers to do is I'm going to tell the computers to do is to rotate these cubes to rotate these cubes to rotate these cubes so that they are so that they are so that they are aligned with the circle and then the aligned with the circle and then the aligned with the circle and then the next one we want is a line all right a next one we want is a line all right a next one we want is a line all right a line you lowering to Vector I want to line you lowering to Vector I want to line you lowering to Vector I want to put the rotation into no we don't want put the rotation into no we don't want put the rotation into no we don't want to put into vector to put into vector to put into vector and we want to put the rotation to and we want to put the rotation to and we want to put the rotation to rotation you can see rotation you can see rotation you can see that's worked out quite nicely so you that's worked out quite nicely so you that's worked out quite nicely so you can see straight away there that they're can see straight away there that they're can see straight away there that they're all lined outwards from the normal you all lined outwards from the normal you all lined outwards from the normal you can do this on other things like can do this on other things like can do this on other things like cylinders and such like so uh it's quite cylinders and such like so uh it's quite cylinders and such like so uh it's quite a powerful tool though very useful a powerful tool though very useful a powerful tool though very useful for your projects for your projects for your projects put these to one side for now put these to one side for now put these to one side for now we want to do is we want to we want to we want to do is we want to we want to we want to do is we want to we want to create some kind of very basic animation create some kind of very basic animation create some kind of very basic animation effect here what we're going to do how effect here what we're going to do how effect here what we're going to do how we're going to do that is we're going to we're going to do that is we're going to we're going to do that is we're going to have our Moroni texture have our Moroni texture have our Moroni texture and we're going to put that into the and we're going to put that into the and we're going to put that into the scaling so I'll do distance to scale scaling so I'll do distance to scale scaling so I'll do distance to scale there we go what you'll see there is there we go what you'll see there is there we go what you'll see there is it's scaling all three directions now it's scaling all three directions now it's scaling all three directions now you can yeah it's great you can do that you can yeah it's great you can do that you can yeah it's great you can do that but the problem is when we uh when we but the problem is when we uh when we but the problem is when we uh when we start to make these quite large they'll start to make these quite large they'll start to make these quite large they'll start overlapping each other and that's start overlapping each other and that's start overlapping each other and that's not great so not great so not great so um let's put our multiply in um let's put our multiply in um let's put our multiply in I want to make it a bit oh no it's math I want to make it a bit oh no it's math I want to make it a bit oh no it's math I'm trying to write multiply it's I'm trying to write multiply it's I'm trying to write multiply it's actually math I'm after so I plug the actually math I'm after so I plug the actually math I'm after so I plug the math into there and let's multiply make math into there and let's multiply make math into there and let's multiply make a big number we can see there straight a big number we can see there straight a big number we can see there straight away it's going over away it's going over away it's going over so that's not especially great so that's not especially great so that's not especially great what we're going to do is we're going to what we're going to do is we're going to what we're going to do is we're going to tell it tell it tell it not that big and I only want this to go not that big and I only want this to go not that big and I only want this to go in the Z Direction so I need to break in the Z Direction so I need to break in the Z Direction so I need to break this scale down so if I declutter that this scale down so if I declutter that this scale down so if I declutter that you can see this affects all three scale you can see this affects all three scale you can see this affects all three scale Direction so whoops don't want to do Direction so whoops don't want to do Direction so whoops don't want to do that I don't want to do that that I don't want to do that that I don't want to do that so I want to break it down and to do so I want to break it down and to do so I want to break it down and to do that we use a combine that we use a combine that we use a combine XYZ XYZ XYZ mode mode mode that way that way that way there we go and we'll make them one there we go and we'll make them one there we go and we'll make them one there you go so it's now only affecting there you go so it's now only affecting there you go so it's now only affecting in the Z Direction and that's uh that's in the Z Direction and that's uh that's in the Z Direction and that's uh that's pretty cool I'll add that pretty cool I'll add that pretty cool I'll add that so that is straight into that now show me yeah you straight into that now show me yeah you straight into that now show me yeah you know what let's let's do the basics just know what let's let's do the basics just know what let's let's do the basics just to show to show to show um what we're doing today so what you're um what we're doing today so what you're um what we're doing today so what you're probably used to seeing if you're making probably used to seeing if you're making probably used to seeing if you're making visualizers visualizers visualizers the graph editor the graph editor the graph editor what you might be used to seeing is say what you might be used to seeing is say what you might be used to seeing is say uh insert keyframe uh insert keyframe uh insert keyframe okay I've got that switched on Mission okay I've got that switched on Mission okay I've got that switched on Mission that is switched on and you go to key that is switched on and you go to key that is switched on and you go to key to do bake sales to ref curves and let's to do bake sales to ref curves and let's to do bake sales to ref curves and let's just just just move this over here so we'll have a need to get a better filing we'll have a need to get a better filing we'll have a need to get a better filing system system system there we go now I've picked this track uh Patrick now I've picked this track uh Patrick now I've picked this track uh Patrick patricus patricus even sorry Dark Side patricus patricus even sorry Dark Side patricus patricus even sorry Dark Side very cool track what you're used to very cool track what you're used to very cool track what you're used to seeing is it's probably something like seeing is it's probably something like seeing is it's probably something like that where you just drop that in and we that where you just drop that in and we that where you just drop that in and we can play around with some of these can play around with some of these can play around with some of these numbers all right well sometimes looks pretty all right well sometimes looks pretty all right well sometimes looks pretty cool cool cool there we go and that's that's tip that's that is and that's that's tip that's that is and that's that's tip that's that is your absolute Bare Basics visualizer and your absolute Bare Basics visualizer and your absolute Bare Basics visualizer and you know that's that's pretty cool it'll you know that's that's pretty cool it'll you know that's that's pretty cool it'll uh it'll react it looks pretty good uh it'll react it looks pretty good uh it'll react it looks pretty good against the music the problem is though against the music the problem is though against the music the problem is though it's every layer of that track so if I it's every layer of that track so if I it's every layer of that track so if I was to let's stop this you can actually was to let's stop this you can actually was to let's stop this you can actually hear it and what I'm going to do now is hear it and what I'm going to do now is hear it and what I'm going to do now is go to video sequence I know I don't I go to video sequence I know I don't I go to video sequence I know I don't I want to go into video sequencer hmm I do want to go to video sequels up hmm I do want to go to video sequels up hmm I do want to go to video sequels up there something a bit creepy going on there something a bit creepy going on there something a bit creepy going on there that's weird there that's weird there that's weird okay let's go back to that screen and do okay let's go back to that screen and do okay let's go back to that screen and do it here it here it here creepy weird stuff creepy weird stuff creepy weird stuff put video sequence uh and then if I go put video sequence uh and then if I go put video sequence uh and then if I go back to my file and I just drop and I just drop and I just drop that track in there and then we play it foreign there's a lot of things going on and there's a lot of things going on and there's a lot of things going on and what we want to do is uh not necessarily what we want to do is uh not necessarily what we want to do is uh not necessarily have this particular beam react to have this particular beam react to have this particular beam react to everything we want it to react to everything we want it to react to everything we want it to react to certain parts of it so let's go back certain parts of it so let's go back certain parts of it so let's go back into our graph editor let's go back to into our graph editor let's go back to into our graph editor let's go back to geometry nodes and let's just kill that geometry nodes and let's just kill that geometry nodes and let's just kill that one clear keyframes now what we want to one clear keyframes now what we want to one clear keyframes now what we want to do is uh let's leave Patrick petricos's do is uh let's leave Patrick petricos's do is uh let's leave Patrick petricos's dark side in there it's uh free to dark side in there it's uh free to dark side in there it's uh free to download from YouTube studio download from YouTube studio download from YouTube studio um there's plenty of versions of it um there's plenty of versions of it um there's plenty of versions of it online as well online as well online as well um what I want to do there is we want to um what I want to do there is we want to um what I want to do there is we want to break this down into its kind of Sub sub break this down into its kind of Sub sub break this down into its kind of Sub sub level so individual instruments and I level so individual instruments and I level so individual instruments and I found a really cool website to do that found a really cool website to do that found a really cool website to do that um it's called um it's called um it's called Moises and essentially what you do is Moises and essentially what you do is Moises and essentially what you do is um it's it's free for a limited number um it's it's free for a limited number um it's it's free for a limited number of tracks of tracks of tracks um what you do you drop your track in um what you do you drop your track in um what you do you drop your track in you get it to do a track separation and you get it to do a track separation and you get it to do a track separation and then it'll spit out another folder and then it'll spit out another folder and then it'll spit out another folder and in that folder in that folder in that folder it will divide it will divide it will divide your track into each of these individual your track into each of these individual your track into each of these individual bits so if I was to click that one bits so if I was to click that one bits so if I was to click that one [Music] okay okay okay same with that one and miniature and miniature and miniature and finally this one and finally this one and finally this one [Music] [Music] [Music] so subdivided it so what we're going to so subdivided it so what we're going to so subdivided it so what we're going to do now is we're going to do something do now is we're going to do something do now is we're going to do something very similar to what you typically used very similar to what you typically used very similar to what you typically used to see through other visualizer to see through other visualizer to see through other visualizer um um um tutorials but this time we're going to tutorials but this time we're going to tutorials but this time we're going to divide it so I'm going to insert divide it so I'm going to insert divide it so I'm going to insert keyframe again but this time keyframe again but this time keyframe again but this time I want to make sure that's letting make I want to make sure that's letting make I want to make sure that's letting make sure that's selected insert keyframe sure that's selected insert keyframe sure that's selected insert keyframe make a sound make a sound make a sound and I want to do that one and I want to do that one and I want to do that one so now so now so now when I go to timeline it's not immediately obvious but when we it's not immediately obvious but when we it's not immediately obvious but when we start adding more detail now let's move this one over here now let's move this one over here now let's move this one over here D down to there and then D down to there and then D down to there and then join join join geometry there there there now what we want to do is we're creating now what we want to do is we're creating now what we want to do is we're creating another Circle so we're going to make another Circle so we're going to make another Circle so we're going to make this one let's say 0.75 this one let's say 0.75 this one let's say 0.75 you can see that it's now created two you can see that it's now created two you can see that it's now created two rows rows rows of rfx play around perhaps make that a little play around perhaps make that a little play around perhaps make that a little bit bigger bit bigger bit bigger and on this one and on this one and on this one I always like to put it back to zero I always like to put it back to zero I always like to put it back to zero there there's another insert keyframe graph editor graph editor graph editor again oops make sure that that is again oops make sure that that is again oops make sure that that is connected that's selected and that's connected that's selected and that's connected that's selected and that's selected at the same time selected at the same time selected at the same time and then fake sound and we go for that and then fake sound and we go for that and then fake sound and we go for that bit there so that middle bit is there reacting to so that middle bit is there reacting to so that middle bit is there reacting to it and you can it and you can it and you can play around with the scaling there as play around with the scaling there as play around with the scaling there as well to make you do some pretty funky well to make you do some pretty funky well to make you do some pretty funky funky things and then let's add a final funky things and then let's add a final funky things and then let's add a final yep 50. yep 50. yep 50. a little bit of organization you might a little bit of organization you might a little bit of organization you might find that some of these cubes and some find that some of these cubes and some find that some of these cubes and some of these of these of these um um um nodes can actually be common nodes okay okay okay and then same again go back to zero and then same again go back to zero and then same again go back to zero and we want to make that one a little and we want to make that one a little and we want to make that one a little bit bigger so let's make it 1.25 bit bigger so let's make it 1.25 bit bigger so let's make it 1.25 I want to bring that down I want to bring that down I want to bring that down a little bit lower a little bit lower a little bit lower and then insert a keyframe and then insert a keyframe and then insert a keyframe and again and again and again I was going to show that selected and I was going to show that selected and I was going to show that selected and that's selected and the final bit there and the final bit there and the final bit there you can see that that one is quite a bit you can see that that one is quite a bit you can see that that one is quite a bit lower lower lower so it's so it's so it's going to react like that that's pretty going to react like that that's pretty going to react like that that's pretty cool and yeah that is your fundamental cool and yeah that is your fundamental cool and yeah that is your fundamental absolute basic uh engine behind this uh absolute basic uh engine behind this uh absolute basic uh engine behind this uh so let's start adding some more details so let's start adding some more details so let's start adding some more details so we're going to do some a set so we're going to do some a set so we're going to do some a set material material material I'm going to put that there I'm going to I'm going to put that there I'm going to I'm going to put that there I'm going to 50 50 shift 50 50 shift 50 50 shift d d d put them in there what I'm going to do is we want to go to what I'm going to do is we want to go to what I'm going to do is we want to go to this I'm going to do something very this I'm going to do something very this I'm going to do something very basic here and we're just going to color basic here and we're just going to color basic here and we're just going to color this this this uh inners go to that create a kind of silver see go to that create a kind of silver see go to that create a kind of silver see OCR CEO and oops if we actually can see what I'm and oops if we actually can see what I'm and oops if we actually can see what I'm doing doing doing and there's and there's and there's inners and I what I'm going to do let's inners and I what I'm going to do let's inners and I what I'm going to do let's switch the same it's that mode there switch the same it's that mode there switch the same it's that mode there I want to make it shiny so that's a I want to make it shiny so that's a I want to make it shiny so that's a metallic it's down the roughness um um um as well Reflections so like this Reflections so like this Reflections so like this zoom in there and let's make the zoom in there and let's make the zoom in there and let's make the background really dark okay okay okay that doesn't look that doesn't look that doesn't look tremendously impressive yet however tremendously impressive yet however tremendously impressive yet however we're about to weave some magic we're about to weave some magic we're about to weave some magic let's go to one of these what I'm going let's go to one of these what I'm going let's go to one of these what I'm going to do is we're going to create a bit of to do is we're going to create a bit of to do is we're going to create a bit of a light effect around each one of these a light effect around each one of these a light effect around each one of these so we want to go to uh measured curve so we want to go to uh measured curve so we want to go to uh measured curve you've seen me do this before if you're you've seen me do this before if you're you've seen me do this before if you're a fan of the channel a fan of the channel a fan of the channel let's put that to there uh curve to mesh and let's put that down to Children and let's put that down to Children and let's put that down to Children geometry geometry geometry so that's created another band uh it's so that's created another band uh it's so that's created another band uh it's around this middle one here it says you around this middle one here it says you around this middle one here it says you can't see it yet but it is there can't see it yet but it is there can't see it yet but it is there and what we're going to do is we're and what we're going to do is we're and what we're going to do is we're going to go Circle curve a curved Circle or the other it's curve a curved Circle or the other it's curve a curved Circle or the other it's gonna go crazy there and we'll make that gonna go crazy there and we'll make that gonna go crazy there and we'll make that tiny tiny tiny about that so you could just about see a line around this a line around this a line around this okay okay okay I'm going to do is go set material again go into our materials new material uh go into our materials new material uh go into our materials new material uh let's call it beam one and what I'm going to do is a very and what I'm going to do is a very and what I'm going to do is a very simple emission B1 go to there I make it sound five way around I quite like the effect the way that's I quite like the effect the way that's I quite like the effect the way that's kind of bouncing up kind of bouncing up kind of bouncing up it's animated it's animated it's animated it looks really cool there of course you could play around with of course you could play around with of course you could play around with this okay so also before you go any further okay so also before you go any further okay so also before you go any further just make sure you've got switched on just make sure you've got switched on just make sure you've got switched on Bloom and Subspace Reflections and that Bloom and Subspace Reflections and that Bloom and Subspace Reflections and that allows the light to bounce off even in allows the light to bounce off even in allows the light to bounce off even in either mode it allows the amounts from either mode it allows the amounts from either mode it allows the amounts from emission to go into these parties so emission to go into these parties so emission to go into these parties so let's just copy that let's just copy that let's just copy that so shift e and I need to go down here so shift e and I need to go down here so shift e and I need to go down here somewhere oh dear somewhere oh dear somewhere oh dear easier if I just do that join join join join join join beam one and let's create some more beam one and let's create some more beam one and let's create some more let's do that very quickly let's do that very quickly let's do that very quickly could just do it this way actually a lot could just do it this way actually a lot could just do it this way actually a lot quicker quicker quicker into shading into shading into shading copy copy copy copy copy copy two and let's change that to you you you helps if you have it switched on helps if you have it switched on helps if you have it switched on into and just play around and just play around and just play around play around with it same again same again same again shift d down here shift d down here shift d down here connect up to there and in you go and in you go and in you go let's make that one another one shading let's make that one another one shading let's make that one another one shading duplicate again and then three duplicate again and then three duplicate again and then three [Music] again it helps if you actually select again it helps if you actually select again it helps if you actually select them three three three okay so that is fundamentally your uh your basic layout just your uh your basic layout just your uh your basic layout just checking what we did before checking what we did before checking what we did before this this this do a value do a value do a value it's quite useful if you want to make it's quite useful if you want to make it's quite useful if you want to make everything consistent Circle one one one there we go actually that's quite cool that one that one that one over there so that is over there so that is over there so that is very quickly very quickly very quickly there we go [Music] [Music] [Music] so you can see here now so you can see here now so you can see here now [Music] [Music] [Music] let's close that up you can see here now let's close that up you can see here now let's close that up you can see here now how each one of these is kind of is how each one of these is kind of is how each one of these is kind of is reacting to a different part of that reacting to a different part of that reacting to a different part of that instrument essentially it's divide we've instrument essentially it's divide we've instrument essentially it's divide we've divided the track into its individual divided the track into its individual divided the track into its individual instruments and then assigned it to a instruments and then assigned it to a instruments and then assigned it to a particular uh part of the visualizer and particular uh part of the visualizer and particular uh part of the visualizer and I think that looks really quite cool I think that looks really quite cool I think that looks really quite cool actually so actually so actually so um one last thing we're going to do to um one last thing we're going to do to um one last thing we're going to do to our geometry node our geometry node our geometry node I'll have to put a little ring around I'll have to put a little ring around I'll have to put a little ring around this so I'm gonna go this so I'm gonna go this so I'm gonna go let's find a little bit of space in fact let's find a little bit of space in fact let's find a little bit of space in fact let's move this up here let's move this up here let's move this up here look we're done we've done all that look we're done we've done all that look we're done we've done all that stuff down there and we're going to do a stuff down there and we're going to do a stuff down there and we're going to do a mesh curve my circle even let's plug that straight my circle even let's plug that straight my circle even let's plug that straight into there into there into there let's make that a bit wider this let's make that a bit wider this let's make that a bit wider this actually rig it so you can see it um I actually rig it so you can see it um I actually rig it so you can see it um I think I've got a bit too far there too think I've got a bit too far there too think I've got a bit too far there too 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.75 yeah 1.75 and then it's kind of dimash care Circle looks like a jam donut let's move that a looks like a jam donut let's move that a looks like a jam donut let's move that a little bit easier to see it doesn't need little bit easier to see it doesn't need little bit easier to see it doesn't need to be as big as that to be as big as that to be as big as that again play around again play around again play around to your heart's content hey hey hey actually that's the point we're gonna actually that's the point we're gonna actually that's the point we're gonna very quickly play around with that very quickly play around with that very quickly play around with that number don't we let's just add a value let's put it into there oops it's around here somewhere it's around here somewhere it's around here somewhere 32 32. 1 up to there 1 up to there 1 up to there okay so if I zoom in now okay so if I zoom in now okay so if I zoom in now let's just see what happens let's just see what happens let's just see what happens so we can start making let's say 62 it's so we can start making let's say 62 it's so we can start making let's say 62 it's making pretty big quite a lot going on there but you can quite a lot going on there but you can quite a lot going on there but you can see by having uh by having more of these see by having uh by having more of these see by having uh by having more of these vertices than uh vertices than uh vertices than uh it does populate a bit more it makes it it does populate a bit more it makes it it does populate a bit more it makes it look a bit smoother final thing we're look a bit smoother final thing we're look a bit smoother final thing we're going to do is we're going to add going to do is we're going to add going to do is we're going to add a bit of a bit of a bit of set material submit set material and go into your submit set material and go into your submit set material and go into your shading Tab and the one we're just We're shading Tab and the one we're just We're shading Tab and the one we're just We're not gonna go special crazy we're just not gonna go special crazy we're just not gonna go special crazy we're just going to do that going to do that going to do that and let's make that let's see there let's see there let's see there always remember always remember always remember to set so there you go that is your absolute so there you go that is your absolute so there you go that is your absolute basic basic basic um visualizer with a bit of a Twist and um visualizer with a bit of a Twist and um visualizer with a bit of a Twist and of course there are a variety of things of course there are a variety of things of course there are a variety of things you can do to the background to make it you can do to the background to make it you can do to the background to make it stand out a bit more stand out a bit more stand out a bit more um but yeah that's that's essentially it um but yeah that's that's essentially it um but yeah that's that's essentially it so let's put this up on screen so just so let's put this up on screen so just so let's put this up on screen so just to go through it one more time you only to go through it one more time you only to go through it one more time you only really need to worry about one of these really need to worry about one of these really need to worry about one of these um um um we start off with our mesh Circle we start off with our mesh Circle we start off with our mesh Circle instance to points we put a cube into instance to points we put a cube into instance to points we put a cube into there you can put any anything you want there you can put any anything you want there you can put any anything you want in there you could put cylinders you can in there you could put cylinders you can in there you could put cylinders you can put up spheres even a bespoke geometry put up spheres even a bespoke geometry put up spheres even a bespoke geometry in there if you wanted uh then we added in there if you wanted uh then we added in there if you wanted uh then we added uh I um uh I um uh I um there we go the Align to Vector there we go the Align to Vector there we go the Align to Vector um um um node set to normal so they're all node set to normal so they're all node set to normal so they're all pointed outwards put that into position pointed outwards put that into position pointed outwards put that into position scaling over even rather rotation the scaling over even rather rotation the scaling over even rather rotation the scaling we want to multiply vorado scaling we want to multiply vorado scaling we want to multiply vorado texture we used texture we used texture we used this minnowski this minnowski this minnowski voronoy you can use anything you want voronoy you can use anything you want voronoy you can use anything you want wave textures work brilliantly as well wave textures work brilliantly as well wave textures work brilliantly as well um we applied it in the Z Direction and um we applied it in the Z Direction and um we applied it in the Z Direction and then we have essentially two bands now then we have essentially two bands now then we have essentially two bands now where we go right I want to get the kind where we go right I want to get the kind where we go right I want to get the kind of a line around each of these cubes and of a line around each of these cubes and of a line around each of these cubes and I want to animate that with a beam or a I want to animate that with a beam or a I want to animate that with a beam or a Illuminating with a beam and then we've Illuminating with a beam and then we've Illuminating with a beam and then we've got this finally put it in the rain and got this finally put it in the rain and got this finally put it in the rain and that is just kind of a that is just kind of a that is just kind of a in fact this if you have the in fact this if you have the in fact this if you have the computational Firepower computational Firepower computational Firepower you could set this to uh 500 I said that let's let's just make it 500 I said that let's let's just make it 500 I said that let's let's just make it 200. I found actually that the image 200. I found actually that the image 200. I found actually that the image looks pretty cool even as a standalone looks pretty cool even as a standalone looks pretty cool even as a standalone so that's not a bad background so that's not a bad background so that's not a bad background um let's see so if that looks a bit dull um let's see so if that looks a bit dull um let's see so if that looks a bit dull at the moment if you put it to EV mode at the moment if you put it to EV mode at the moment if you put it to EV mode we've turned our blooms on so we've turned our blooms on so we've turned our blooms on so it should be pretty quick this it should be pretty quick this it should be pretty quick this point three of a second that looks point three of a second that looks point three of a second that looks pretty cool as is but if you were to go pretty cool as is but if you were to go pretty cool as is but if you were to go into compositing into compositing into compositing and add and add and add just a simple glare set it to fog glow set it to fog glow set it to fog glow just to see there and then we hit the just to see there and then we hit the just to see there and then we hit the render make sure you use mode to switch render make sure you use mode to switch render make sure you use mode to switch on hit the render again but on your on hit the render again but on your on hit the render again but on your Cycles GPU compute is important have Cycles GPU compute is important have Cycles GPU compute is important have that set to like it doesn't need to be 4 that set to like it doesn't need to be 4 that set to like it doesn't need to be 4 000. why blender does that 000. why blender does that 000. why blender does that turn that on turn that on turn that on so it takes a little bit longer to run so it takes a little bit longer to run so it takes a little bit longer to run it's now going to do that that looks it's now going to do that that looks it's now going to do that that looks pretty pretty cool as well so there's a pretty pretty cool as well so there's a pretty pretty cool as well so there's a wealth of things the other problem is wealth of things the other problem is wealth of things the other problem is that's going to take five seconds now that's going to take five seconds now that's going to take five seconds now normally a music track is going to be normally a music track is going to be normally a music track is going to be about three minutes uh 24 about three minutes uh 24 about three minutes uh 24 frames so that is going to take a frames so that is going to take a frames so that is going to take a mountain of time to animate as a uh as mountain of time to animate as a uh as mountain of time to animate as a uh as an animation uh so um yeah probably best an animation uh so um yeah probably best an animation uh so um yeah probably best to stick to Evie really to stick to Evie really to stick to Evie really so let's stick to EV and the way to the so let's stick to EV and the way to the so let's stick to EV and the way to the way to Output this if you if you're way to Output this if you if you're way to Output this if you if you're curious is you uh let's pick a location curious is you uh let's pick a location curious is you uh let's pick a location that's you know temp files fine that's you know temp files fine that's you know temp files fine um um um there's your eyes are one one one except you want to switch that one to except you want to switch that one to except you want to switch that one to MPEG I find these these work really best MPEG I find these these work really best MPEG I find these these work really best for me mpeg-4 for me mpeg-4 for me mpeg-4 um so it's medium quality I like um so it's medium quality I like um so it's medium quality I like perceptually lossless perceptually lossless perceptually lossless and MP3 and that's it off you go and and MP3 and that's it off you go and and MP3 and that's it off you go and that is pretty much it the only other that is pretty much it the only other that is pretty much it the only other thing to add is that uh for the music we thing to add is that uh for the music we thing to add is that uh for the music we want to make sure we get it all in uh actually helps to film the video uh actually helps to film the video uh actually helps to film the video there we go so you can see this track there we go so you can see this track there we go so you can see this track dark side goes quite far so you just dark side goes quite far so you just dark side goes quite far so you just want to make sure that you do indeed want to make sure that you do indeed want to make sure that you do indeed capture the whole night I think the capture the whole night I think the capture the whole night I think the quick quick sum is two point let's say quick quick sum is two point let's say quick quick sum is two point let's say 2.75 times 24 times 60 so it's 24 frames 2.75 times 24 times 60 so it's 24 frames 2.75 times 24 times 60 so it's 24 frames per second 60 seconds two two in a bit per second 60 seconds two two in a bit per second 60 seconds two two in a bit minutes it's going to go over line and minutes it's going to go over line and minutes it's going to go over line and just drag that back until it lines up just drag that back until it lines up just drag that back until it lines up and when you're happy hit the go button and when you're happy hit the go button and when you're happy hit the go button and there you go it will it will animate and there you go it will it will animate and there you go it will it will animate that and um yeah that'll look pretty that and um yeah that'll look pretty that and um yeah that'll look pretty pretty cool when it's done foreign [Music] [Music]
