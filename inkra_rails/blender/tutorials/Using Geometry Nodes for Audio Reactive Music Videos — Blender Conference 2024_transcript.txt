what I'd like to do today is to create what I'd like to do today is to create an audio visualizer completely from an audio visualizer completely from an audio visualizer completely from scratch uh utilizing a number of the scratch uh utilizing a number of the scratch uh utilizing a number of the concepts that I've demonstrated there concepts that I've demonstrated there concepts that I've demonstrated there I've actually got there we go I've got I've actually got there we go I've got I've actually got there we go I've got this video um that that I put together this video um that that I put together this video um that that I put together as a demonstration ahead of of this as a demonstration ahead of of this as a demonstration ahead of of this conference uh the music for this was put conference uh the music for this was put conference uh the music for this was put together and arranged and mixed and together and arranged and mixed and together and arranged and mixed and recorded by a very good friend of mine recorded by a very good friend of mine recorded by a very good friend of mine Greg Roberts who specifically recorded Greg Roberts who specifically recorded Greg Roberts who specifically recorded this audio specifically for blender this audio specifically for blender this audio specifically for blender conference um so I'm just going to play conference um so I'm just going to play conference um so I'm just going to play this and this is what we're going to be this and this is what we're going to be this and this is what we're going to be creating live in a creating live in a creating live in a moment if it will play oh [Music] so that's what we're going to start so that's what we're going to start so that's what we're going to start creating L thank you well hopefully by the end of this you well hopefully by the end of this you well hopefully by the end of this you'll all know how to make that and you you'll all know how to make that and you you'll all know how to make that and you can give yourselves a round of applause can give yourselves a round of applause can give yourselves a round of applause so I'm going to jump over to blender so I'm going to jump over to blender so I'm going to jump over to blender I've got a brand new scene I'm uh using I've got a brand new scene I'm uh using I've got a brand new scene I'm uh using 4.2 and I'm

I'm just going to delete the light though um I'm go into delete the light though um I'm go into delete the light though um I'm go into front view uh Control Alt front view uh Control Alt front view uh Control Alt zero ah of course it's not doing that zero ah of course it's not doing that zero ah of course it's not doing that hang on well you ski steps hang on well you ski steps hang on well you ski

create my camera control alt zero to create my camera control alt zero to create my camera view uh in front view and the default view uh in front view and the default view uh in front view and the default cube is what we're going to use as the cube is what we're going to use as the cube is what we're going to use as the the canvas for creating our uh the canvas for creating our uh the canvas for creating our uh visualizer you could use whatever shape visualizer you could use whatever shape visualizer you could use whatever shape you wanted you could use a sphere you you wanted you could use a sphere you you wanted you could use a sphere you could use a suzan head do it whatever could use a suzan head do it whatever could use a suzan head do it whatever you wanted um I'm going to go into edit you wanted um I'm going to go into edit you wanted um I'm going to go into edit mode though and scale this up twice on mode though and scale this up twice on mode though and scale this up twice on the x- axis just to give me a bit more the x- axis just to give me a bit more the x- axis just to give me a bit more uh room to work with let's go over to uh room to work with let's go over to uh room to work with let's go over to Geometry nodes uh add a new geometry Geometry nodes uh add a new geometry Geometry nodes uh add a new geometry node setup and this is where we're going node setup and this is where we're going node setup and this is where we're going to start building things out let's turn to start building things out let's turn to start building things out let's turn off my rels and widgets and off my rels and widgets and off my rels and widgets and withar so what we're going to do is withar so what we're going to do is withar so what we're going to do is start by turning this mesh into a volume start by turning this mesh into a volume start by turning this mesh into a volume so we're going go mesh to so we're going go mesh to so we're going go mesh to volume and then we're going to volume and then we're going to volume and then we're going to distribute some points inside that distribute some points inside that distribute some points inside that volume we're not going to work with volume we're not going to work with volume we're not going to work with instances here I'm just going to render instances here I'm just going to render instances here I'm just going to render these directly as points um but of these directly as points um but of these directly as points um but of course you could you know do an instance course you could you know do an instance course you could you know do an instance on points node later on and put on points node later on and put on points node later on and put instances onto them which is how we did instances onto them which is how we did instances onto them which is how we did things like the Jacob colia work um I'm things like the Jacob colia work um I'm things like the Jacob colia work um I'm not going to leave this as random I'm not going to leave this as random I'm not going to leave this as random I'm actually going to go with a grid layout actually going to go with a grid layout actually going to go with a grid layout I think it's just going to look a little I think it's just going to look a little I think it's just going to look a little better and for our spacing this is where better and for our spacing this is where better and for our spacing this is where we can start creating the density of our we can start creating the density of our we can start creating the density of our uh visualizer so what I'm actually going uh visualizer so what I'm actually going uh visualizer so what I'm actually going to do is use a switch so that I can to do is use a switch so that I can to do is use a switch so that I can basically have like a preview and a basically have like a preview and a basically have like a preview and a render density and if I use the is render density and if I use the is render density and if I use the is viewport node viewport node viewport node I've basically now got a switch where I've basically now got a switch where I've basically now got a switch where the true value is going to be my um the true value is going to be my um the true value is going to be my um density in my viewport and the false is density in my viewport and the false is density in my viewport and the false is going to be the density in render so I'm going to be the density in render so I'm going to be the density in render so I'm going to go with 01 and 05 for the going to go with 01 and 05 for the going to go with 01 and 05 for the render for the moment we could render for the moment we could render for the moment we could parameterize these we might need to parameterize these we might need to parameterize these we might need to change them later change them later change them later um I'm also going to do the same thing um I'm also going to do the same thing um I'm also going to do the same thing for the point radius so I can duplicate for the point radius so I can duplicate for the point radius so I can duplicate these hook this up to our radius and I'm going hook this up to our radius and I'm going hook this up to our radius and I'm going to go with a viewport density of to go with a viewport density of to go with a viewport density of 02 and a false so render value of 02 and a false so render value of 02 and a false so render value of 01 so now we've got our points started 01 so now we've got our points started 01 so now we've got our points started I'm going to contrl J add these into a I'm going to contrl J add these into a I'm going to contrl J add these into a frame and we'll call it points just frame and we'll call it points just frame and we'll call it points just going to try and keep things nice and going to try and keep things nice and going to try and keep things nice and organized um whenever I'm creating organized um whenever I'm creating organized um whenever I'm creating geometry node geometry node geometry node networks I get a little bit um kind of networks I get a little bit um kind of networks I get a little bit um kind of OCD about my geometry nodes layouts and OCD about my geometry nodes layouts and OCD about my geometry nodes layouts and like having things nice and organized like having things nice and organized like having things nice and organized and framed and framed and framed up so the way that we're going to um up so the way that we're going to um up so the way that we're going to um start building this out is by building start building this out is by building start building this out is by building layers of noise that we will then layers of noise that we will then layers of noise that we will then animate uh with our audio values so I'm animate uh with our audio values so I'm animate uh with our audio values so I'm going to start by just building those going to start by just building those going to start by just building those layers of noise up and then we'll bring layers of noise up and then we'll bring layers of noise up and then we'll bring in our audio afterwards so to start I'm in our audio afterwards so to start I'm in our audio afterwards so to start I'm going to use a set position going to use a set position going to use a set position node going to add a noise node going to add a noise node going to add a noise texture and whenever we're using a noise texture and whenever we're using a noise texture and whenever we're using a noise texture to change the position of points texture to change the position of points texture to change the position of points we always need to we always need to we always need to subtract subtract subtract 0.5 from the vector uh this will Center 0.5 from the vector uh this will Center 0.5 from the vector uh this will Center our Vector around the zero point means our Vector around the zero point means our Vector around the zero point means that they don't get offset wonky we're that they don't get offset wonky we're that they don't get offset wonky we're going to plug this into our offset and going to plug this into our offset and going to plug this into our offset and immediately law looks a little bit crazy immediately law looks a little bit crazy immediately law looks a little bit crazy we're going to set this to 4D so that we we're going to set this to 4D so that we we're going to set this to 4D so that we have a w value to change our noise scale have a w value to change our noise scale have a w value to change our noise scale needs to be way smaller and I'm actually needs to be way smaller and I'm actually needs to be way smaller and I'm actually going to change this I think from fbm to going to change this I think from fbm to going to change this I think from fbm to we'll go ridge multifactor to start we'll go ridge multifactor to start we'll go ridge multifactor to start with re offset with re offset with re offset this and we're going to need to make the this and we're going to need to make the this and we're going to need to make the scale a lot scale a lot scale a lot smaller so 01 and then we can increase smaller so 01 and then we can increase smaller so 01 and then we can increase the the the Distortion uh quite a lot to say 100 so now let's go with hybrid 100 so now let's go with hybrid 100 so now let's go with hybrid multiactor instead there we go that multiactor instead there we go that multiactor instead there we go that looks a bit better so now we've got a w looks a bit better so now we've got a w looks a bit better so now we've got a w Factor where we could as we move this up Factor where we could as we move this up Factor where we could as we move this up and noise is going to distort and that's and noise is going to distort and that's and noise is going to distort and that's going to be the first layer of going to be the first layer of going to be the first layer of Noise We can frame these up and this is Noise We can frame these up and this is Noise We can frame these up and this is going to be our noise for our main riff going to be our noise for our main riff going to be our noise for our main riff uh like the main guitar riff of of the uh like the main guitar riff of of the uh like the main guitar riff of of the uh uh uh music going to do another one so set music going to do another one so set music going to do another one so set position going to add another noise position going to add another noise position going to add another noise texture and instead of just uh texture and instead of just uh texture and instead of just uh subtracting it so we will do subtracting it so we will do subtracting it so we will do that but what I'm also going to do is that but what I'm also going to do is that but what I'm also going to do is multiply this by the multiply this by the multiply this by the position of our points so this is just position of our points so this is just position of our points so this is just going to give us a little bit of an going to give us a little bit of an going to give us a little bit of an added level of added level of added level of complexity so can multiply these complexity so can multiply these complexity so can multiply these together together together and then if we use this as a scale value and then if we use this as a scale value and then if we use this as a scale value we may need to change the scale on this we may need to change the scale on this we may need to change the scale on this hook this up to the offset and this one hook this up to the offset and this one hook this up to the offset and this one will go with a hetro will go with a hetro will go with a hetro Terrain again this the scale is going to Terrain again this the scale is going to Terrain again this the scale is going to need to be a lot smaller 01 going to zero these off and increase 01 going to zero these off and increase 01 going to zero these off and increase our Distortion set it to 4D so again we've Distortion set it to 4D so again we've Distortion set it to 4D so again we've got a got a got a W value that we can change W value that we can change W value that we can change here so now we've got two separate W here so now we've got two separate W here so now we've got two separate W values that we can values that we can values that we can change and in fact I probably need to change and in fact I probably need to change and in fact I probably need to scale that a bit further scale that a bit further scale that a bit further down lower the strength on it to down lower the strength on it to down lower the strength on it to 0.5 we frame these ones up these are 0.5 we frame these ones up these are 0.5 we frame these ones up these are going to be the noise for our lead going to be the noise for our lead going to be the noise for our lead guitar so this is going to be our the guitar so this is going to be our the guitar so this is going to be our the the main kind of solo parts that we the main kind of solo parts that we the main kind of solo parts that we heard during the um during the demo heard during the um during the demo heard during the um during the demo and then finally we want a third layer and then finally we want a third layer and then finally we want a third layer of noise which is going to be our drum of noise which is going to be our drum of noise which is going to be our drum beat and this is going to form that kind beat and this is going to form that kind beat and this is going to form that kind of pulsing motion where every time that of pulsing motion where every time that of pulsing motion where every time that the drum beat hits it pulses outwards so the drum beat hits it pulses outwards so the drum beat hits it pulses outwards so once again we are going to set once again we are going to set once again we are going to set position going to add a noise texture position going to add a noise texture position going to add a noise texture and in fact and in fact and in fact actually what I'm going to do is just actually what I'm going to do is just actually what I'm going to do is just duplicate this whole setup from the duplicate this whole setup from the duplicate this whole setup from the noise lead noise lead noise lead and we can rename this to noise drum hook these up and now this scale drum hook these up and now this scale drum hook these up and now this scale value here let's change this one to value here let's change this one to value here let's change this one to let's change this again so we had a let's change this again so we had a let's change this again so we had a hybrid multifactor a hetro Terrain and hybrid multifactor a hetro Terrain and hybrid multifactor a hetro Terrain and we'll go with a riged multifactor for we'll go with a riged multifactor for we'll go with a riged multifactor for this this this one so now as we scale this in the one so now as we scale this in the one so now as we scale this in the negative direction we're kind of pulsing negative direction we're kind of pulsing negative direction we're kind of pulsing in this outwards and again we've got a in this outwards and again we've got a in this outwards and again we've got a seed value that we can change seed value that we can change seed value that we can change here set these back to zero so that when here set these back to zero so that when here set these back to zero so that when we add our drums in it's going to push we add our drums in it's going to push we add our drums in it's going to push the scale in the negative the scale in the negative the scale in the negative Direction excuse me Direction excuse me Direction excuse me um before we start adding our audio um before we start adding our audio um before we start adding our audio let's set up some materials and the let's set up some materials and the let's set up some materials and the colors for our visualizer so I'm going colors for our visualizer so I'm going colors for our visualizer so I'm going to add a set materal seral to add a set materal seral to add a set materal seral mode I'll split my window and get a Shader window and get a Shader window and get a Shader editor add a new material and I'm just editor add a new material and I'm just editor add a new material and I'm just going to call going to call going to call it emission can get rid of our principal emission can get rid of our principal emission can get rid of our principal bsdf because we don't need it we're just bsdf because we don't need it we're just bsdf because we don't need it we're just going to use an emission going to use an emission going to use an emission Shader hook that up and instead of Shader hook that up and instead of Shader hook that up and instead of controlling the color and the strength controlling the color and the strength controlling the color and the strength inside our shaders I want to use inside our shaders I want to use inside our shaders I want to use attributes from geometry nodes that I attributes from geometry nodes that I attributes from geometry nodes that I can then deal with the color and the can then deal with the color and the can then deal with the color and the strength procedurally inside the strength procedurally inside the strength procedurally inside the geometry nodes Network so let's just geometry nodes Network so let's just geometry nodes Network so let's just turn the strength on our world down to turn the strength on our world down to turn the strength on our world down to zero you can come into zero you can come into zero you can come into EV make sure we're using our seene EV make sure we're using our seene EV make sure we're using our seene world we can set the material in our world we can set the material in our world we can set the material in our geometry geometry geometry nodes um I'm also actually before I set nodes um I'm also actually before I set nodes um I'm also actually before I set up those attributes I'm going to just go up those attributes I'm going to just go up those attributes I'm going to just go to the compositor use nodes and I'm to the compositor use nodes and I'm to the compositor use nodes and I'm going to add a glare node just so we're going to add a glare node just so we're going to add a glare node just so we're going to get a little bit of Bloom set going to get a little bit of Bloom set going to get a little bit of Bloom set these to 0.75 and with a size of I five 0.75 and with a size of I five 0.75 and with a size of I five maybe make sure we enable our compositor maybe make sure we enable our compositor maybe make sure we enable our compositor in our viewport shading five is way too in our viewport shading five is way too in our viewport shading five is way too strong yeah four that'll strong yeah four that'll strong yeah four that'll do let's go back to our Shader and as I do let's go back to our Shader and as I do let's go back to our Shader and as I said instead of control ing the color said instead of control ing the color said instead of control ing the color and the strength from our Shader editor and the strength from our Shader editor and the strength from our Shader editor we're going to use attributes inside our we're going to use attributes inside our we're going to use attributes inside our geometry nodes so all we're going to do geometry nodes so all we're going to do geometry nodes so all we're going to do is add an attribute node we'll call this is add an attribute node we'll call this is add an attribute node we'll call this first one first one first one color and we can duplicate it and we'll color and we can duplicate it and we'll color and we can duplicate it and we'll call this one strength hook these up and of course strength hook these up and of course strength hook these up and of course everything goes black because these do everything goes black because these do everything goes black because these do not currently exist as attributes that's not currently exist as attributes that's not currently exist as attributes that's okay we can now create okay we can now create okay we can now create those so stor end attribute let's get those so stor end attribute let's get those so stor end attribute let's get two of them first one is going to be two of them first one is going to be two of them first one is going to be called color and it's going to be a called color and it's going to be a called color and it's going to be a color on the point color on the point color on the point domain and then the next one will be domain and then the next one will be domain and then the next one will be strength which turns out I can't spell strength which turns out I can't spell strength which turns out I can't spell there we there we there we go so now we can control our color and go so now we can control our color and go so now we can control our color and our strength directly inside of geometry nodes for our color um I want these to nodes for our color um I want these to nodes for our color um I want these to have that kind of um kind of rainbow have that kind of um kind of rainbow have that kind of um kind of rainbow effect where it's going through all the effect where it's going through all the effect where it's going through all the colors of the color spectrum so I'm colors of the color spectrum so I'm colors of the color spectrum so I'm going to use a color going to use a color going to use a color ramp and the way that I'm going to set ramp and the way that I'm going to set ramp and the way that I'm going to set this up is by using the this up is by using the this up is by using the noise Factor right at the beginning from noise Factor right at the beginning from noise Factor right at the beginning from our riff so if I store an attribute our riff so if I store an attribute our riff so if I store an attribute here we'll call this here we'll call this here we'll call this noise and we'll hook up the factor to noise and we'll hook up the factor to noise and we'll hook up the factor to here we can then use this attribute here we can then use this attribute here we can then use this attribute later on for our materials so we're later on for our materials so we're later on for our materials so we're going to get a named going to get a named going to get a named attribute get our attribute get our attribute get our Noise by hooking this into the color Noise by hooking this into the color Noise by hooking this into the color ramp and then the color into the color ramp and then the color into the color ramp and then the color into the color we now have colors that are going to we now have colors that are going to we now have colors that are going to work depending on our work depending on our work depending on our noise so as I change the W value of our noise so as I change the W value of our noise so as I change the W value of our noise those color are going to follow noise those color are going to follow noise those color are going to follow along with along with along with it don't just want to set it as these it don't just want to set it as these it don't just want to set it as these kind of blue and greens though I want a kind of blue and greens though I want a kind of blue and greens though I want a kind of a rainbow effect and there's a kind of a rainbow effect and there's a kind of a rainbow effect and there's a really easy way to do that with the really easy way to do that with the really easy way to do that with the color ramp um if you just change it the color ramp um if you just change it the color ramp um if you just change it the color mode to HSV and change it to far color mode to HSV and change it to far color mode to HSV and change it to far and what we can do is that will and what we can do is that will and what we can do is that will literally call go around the entire literally call go around the entire literally call go around the entire color wheel so I can set the first flag color wheel so I can set the first flag color wheel so I can set the first flag to a hue of zero and a saturation and to a hue of zero and a saturation and to a hue of zero and a saturation and value of one and the second second flag value of one and the second second flag value of one and the second second flag to a human saturation of to a human saturation of to a human saturation of one and now we're going to have a color one and now we're going to have a color one and now we're going to have a color ramp that is going across the entire ramp that is going across the entire ramp that is going across the entire color color color spectrum for our strength as we saw in spectrum for our strength as we saw in spectrum for our strength as we saw in the demo video we wanted different the demo video we wanted different the demo video we wanted different colors to have different strengths and colors to have different strengths and colors to have different strengths and for those to be able to change for those to be able to change for those to be able to change dynamically based on our dynamically based on our dynamically based on our audio well we've already got our noise audio well we've already got our noise audio well we've already got our noise attributes so what I can do is say that attributes so what I can do is say that attributes so what I can do is say that when noise is equal to a certain value when noise is equal to a certain value when noise is equal to a certain value we can use that as a we can use that as a we can use that as a switch to change the strength of our switch to change the strength of our switch to change the strength of our emission so if I plug these into my emission so if I plug these into my emission so if I plug these into my switch we'll say that true we'll say two switch we'll say that true we'll say two switch we'll say that true we'll say two and a false of 0.1 we may need to change and a false of 0.1 we may need to change and a false of 0.1 we may need to change these later as we start playing these uh these later as we start playing these uh these later as we start playing these uh live for audios and now our Epsilon live for audios and now our Epsilon live for audios and now our Epsilon becomes the range of our color r that becomes the range of our color r that becomes the range of our color r that we're going to see so as I scroll this we're going to see so as I scroll this we're going to see so as I scroll this up you know we're going to see a lot up you know we're going to see a lot up you know we're going to see a lot more of it so if I set it to more of it so if I set it to more of it so if I set it to 0.1 we're getting that kind of just that 0.1 we're getting that kind of just that 0.1 we're getting that kind of just that yellow and red area at the back as I yellow and red area at the back as I yellow and red area at the back as I scroll this up we're now going to be scroll this up we're now going to be scroll this up we're now going to be able to change the illuminated color of able to change the illuminated color of able to change the illuminated color of our visualizer and this is a value that our visualizer and this is a value that our visualizer and this is a value that we will plug in to our audio buffer we will plug in to our audio buffer we will plug in to our audio buffer shortly to be able to uh control that shortly to be able to uh control that shortly to be able to uh control that based on the drum beat let's frame these let's frame these let's frame these up and we'll call these materials so now we've got our buffer materials so now we've got our buffer materials so now we've got our buffer well we've got our visualizer set up we well we've got our visualizer set up we well we've got our visualizer set up we actually now need to start bringing in actually now need to start bringing in actually now need to start bringing in our audio and dealing with the audio our audio and dealing with the audio our audio and dealing with the audio reactivity part so the first thing that reactivity part so the first thing that reactivity part so the first thing that I need to do is to bring my audio I need to do is to bring my audio I need to do is to bring my audio actually into blender so I'm going to actually into blender so I'm going to actually into blender so I'm going to change this to the video change this to the video change this to the video sequencer shift a and add sequencer shift a and add sequencer shift a and add sound and if I go to my audio tracks sound and if I go to my audio tracks sound and if I go to my audio tracks folder this is the folder that was folder this is the folder that was folder this is the folder that was downloadable um earlier and in it you'll downloadable um earlier and in it you'll downloadable um earlier and in it you'll see we have four different um audio see we have four different um audio see we have four different um audio files uh we have the drums the lead files uh we have the drums the lead files uh we have the drums the lead guitar and the Riff that are all guitar and the Riff that are all guitar and the Riff that are all separated from each other and then we separated from each other and then we separated from each other and then we have the mix master which is the main have the mix master which is the main have the mix master which is the main Master track of our audio so this is the Master track of our audio so this is the Master track of our audio so this is the audio that we can load in to our video audio that we can load in to our video audio that we can load in to our video sequencer sequencer sequencer so we'll add the sound strip and it's so we'll add the sound strip and it's so we'll add the sound strip and it's obviously far too big for our timeline obviously far too big for our timeline obviously far too big for our timeline so let's check under our time Source so let's check under our time Source so let's check under our time Source here we can see that it's ending at 881 here we can see that it's ending at 881 here we can see that it's ending at 881 so let's change our so let's change our so let's change our frames and let's I'm just going to lower frames and let's I'm just going to lower frames and let's I'm just going to lower this volume cuz I don't know how loud this volume cuz I don't know how loud this volume cuz I don't know how loud this is going to be far too loud my this is going to be far too loud my this is going to be far too loud my apologies 0.1 but that's still too loud there we loud there we loud there we go so so we've now got our audio loaded go so so we've now got our audio loaded go so so we've now got our audio loaded into our video sequencer um the next into our video sequencer um the next into our video sequencer um the next thing that's really important anytime thing that's really important anytime thing that's really important anytime that you are dealing with audio in that you are dealing with audio in that you are dealing with audio in blender is to change your playback from blender is to change your playback from blender is to change your playback from play every frame to sync to audio uh play every frame to sync to audio uh play every frame to sync to audio uh because otherwise what you're going to because otherwise what you're going to because otherwise what you're going to see in the viewport is not going to be see in the viewport is not going to be see in the viewport is not going to be the same or it's not going to be the the same or it's not going to be the the same or it's not going to be the same as when you render because it's same as when you render because it's same as when you render because it's going to try and play every single frame going to try and play every single frame going to try and play every single frame so you need to make sure that you set so you need to make sure that you set so you need to make sure that you set this to sync to audio next we want to start bringing in audio next we want to start bringing in audio next we want to start bringing in those other three audio files that we those other three audio files that we those other three audio files that we can deal with for our seed can deal with for our seed can deal with for our seed values so going to go to My Graph editor and going to add a value editor and going to add a value editor and going to add a value node we'll rename this node as riff node we'll rename this node as riff node we'll rename this node as riff making sure that my playhead is at uh making sure that my playhead is at uh making sure that my playhead is at uh the first frame I'm just going to press the first frame I'm just going to press the first frame I'm just going to press press I to key frame this and I can then press I to key frame this and I can then press I to key frame this and I can then bring this uh I can use our audio files bring this uh I can use our audio files bring this uh I can use our audio files to control this value if we go Channel to control this value if we go Channel to control this value if we go Channel sounds to sounds to sounds to samples and I need to find my audio samples and I need to find my audio samples and I need to find my audio tracks and we've got a bunch of options tracks and we've got a bunch of options tracks and we've got a bunch of options here um you've got like a frequency here um you've got like a frequency here um you've got like a frequency range which basically gives you a well range which basically gives you a well range which basically gives you a well exactly a range of frequencies that will exactly a range of frequencies that will exactly a range of frequencies that will isolate the different uh parts of the isolate the different uh parts of the isolate the different uh parts of the audio um so for instance if you just audio um so for instance if you just audio um so for instance if you just wanted the the base of um an audio you wanted the the base of um an audio you wanted the the base of um an audio you could set this between 250 and 2,000 if could set this between 250 and 2,000 if could set this between 250 and 2,000 if you wanted The Trebles you could do 6 to you wanted The Trebles you could do 6 to you wanted The Trebles you could do 6 to 8,000 uh Etc I'm sure if you just Google 8,000 uh Etc I'm sure if you just Google 8,000 uh Etc I'm sure if you just Google you know the different frequency ranges you know the different frequency ranges you know the different frequency ranges for different parts you can find uh that for different parts you can find uh that

going to do instead is actually what I'm going to do instead is actually what I'm going to do instead is actually build my own build my own build my own accumulated um node for my sound but accumulated um node for my sound but accumulated um node for my sound but buffer using simulation nodes so that's buffer using simulation nodes so that's buffer using simulation nodes so that's where our audio buffer is going to come where our audio buffer is going to come where our audio buffer is going to come in so off of our riff we're going to add in so off of our riff we're going to add in so off of our riff we're going to add a reot node contrl G to put it into its a reot node contrl G to put it into its a reot node contrl G to put it into its own node own node own node group get rid of that and let's rename group get rid of that and let's rename group get rid of that and let's rename our inputs our first input is going to our inputs our first input is going to our inputs our

basically allow you to track do um they basically allow you to track data over time that's the simplest data over time that's the simplest data over time that's the simplest explanation of it um and obviously you explanation of it um and obviously you explanation of it um and obviously you can use that to create very complex can use that to create very complex can use that to create very complex physics simulations or you know crazy physics simulations or you know crazy physics simulations or you know crazy kind of traffic kind of traffic kind of traffic simulations um all we're going to be

just creating a data data uh we're just creating a data data uh we're just creating a data buffer buffer buffer basically to do this we're going to need basically to do this we're going to need basically to do this we're going to need something to store our data on so I'm something to store our data on so I'm something to store our data on so I'm going to add a going to add a going to add a

container and then into something data container and then into something that we can use in our main setup um that we can use in our main setup um that we can use in our main setup um what we're going to do is just sample what we're going to do is just sample what we're going to do is just sample the index we can leave the index at zero index we can leave the index at zero index we can leave the index at zero because there's only one point so it's because there's only one point so it's because there's only one point so it's an index of zero anyway and what we're an index of zero anyway and what we're an index of zero anyway and what we're going to sample is a named going to sample is a named going to sample is a named attribute we're going to call this accumulated and then hook it up to our accumulated and then hook it up to our accumulated and then hook it up to our output obviously we don't have an output obviously we don't have an output obviously we don't have an accumulated attribute yet so we need to accumulated attribute yet so we need to accumulated attribute yet so we need to store one so store named store one so store named store one so store named attribute apologies if I'm going a bit attribute apologies if I'm going a bit attribute apologies if I'm going a bit too fast for everybody by the way that's too fast for everybody by the way that's too fast for everybody by the way that's following along I'm just trying to make following along I'm just trying to make following along I'm just trying to make sure that we get through it on time um sure that we get through it on time um sure that we get through it on time um I'm going to copy and paste the name I'm going to copy and paste the name I'm going to copy and paste the name into my into my into my attribute and and all I need to do is to attribute and and all I need to do is to attribute and and all I need to do is to take my audio and take my audio and take my audio and add the accumulated attribute to it on add the accumulated attribute to it on add the accumulated attribute to it on every frame so that on the first every frame so that on the first every frame so that on the first frame we we don't have frame we we don't have frame we we don't have anything um that's like the accumulated anything um that's like the accumulated anything um that's like the accumulated attribute is at zero because it doesn't attribute is at zero because it doesn't attribute is at zero because it doesn't exist so it's just going to store the exist so it's just going to store the exist so it's just going to store the audio on the second frame it's going to audio on the second frame it's going to audio on the second frame it's going to store it's going to update with the store it's going to update with the store it's going to update with the audio from the previous frame and the audio from the previous frame and the audio from the previous frame and the audio from the second frame and so on audio from the second frame and so on audio from the second frame and so on and so forth so now we have an and so forth so now we have an and so forth so now we have an accumulated uh output and I'm going to accumulated uh output and I'm going to accumulated uh output and I'm going to run this through a multiply node so that run this through a multiply node so that run this through a multiply node so that we've got like a Scala value uh so we we've got like a Scala value uh so we we've got like a Scala value uh so we can control the strength and I'm going can control the strength and I'm going can control the strength and I'm going to set this to say 0.2 and now if I plug to set this to say 0.2 and now if I plug to set this to say 0.2 and now if I plug this into my w for my audio as I play this into my w for my audio as I play this into my w for my audio as I play this [Music] [Music] [Music] through the noise is going to change through the noise is going to change through the noise is going to change over time and as you may have noticed at over time and as you may have noticed at over time and as you may have noticed at the start when that riff slowed down and the start when that riff slowed down and the start when that riff slowed down and there was a noticeable break in the there was a noticeable break in the there was a noticeable break in the audio the visualizer stops moving there uh because there's no more moving there uh because there's no more moving there uh because there's no more frames that are being there's no more frames that are being there's no more frames that are being there's no more data that's being added to our data that's being added to our data that's being added to our accumulated attribute on those frames accumulated attribute on those frames accumulated attribute on those frames because the audio is dropped next we can do exactly the same dropped next we can do exactly the same dropped next we can do exactly the same thing for our lead guitar so let's thing for our lead guitar so let's thing for our lead guitar so let's duplicate all of these duplicate all of these duplicate all of these nodes we'll rename our Riff to be nodes we'll rename our Riff to be nodes we'll rename our Riff to be lead set this back to zero and making lead set this back to zero and making lead set this back to zero and making sure that I'm on the first frame I to sure that I'm on the first frame I to sure that I'm on the first frame I to key frame and we're going to do exactly key frame and we're going to do exactly key frame and we're going to do exactly the same thing channels sounds to the same thing channels sounds to the same thing channels sounds to samples and we'll bring our lead guitar samples and we'll bring our lead guitar samples and we'll bring our lead guitar um we again we can leave the all the um we again we can leave the all the um we again we can leave the all the settings as default for the moment settings as default for the moment settings as default for the moment that's not a that's not a that's not a problem and now we have an audio wave problem and now we have an audio wave problem and now we have an audio wave here that there's nothing at the start here that there's nothing at the start here that there's nothing at the start because the lead guitar doesn't kick in because the lead guitar doesn't kick in because the lead guitar doesn't kick in on this until later on around that 250 on this until later on around that 250 on this until later on around that 250 frame hug this into our frame hug this into our frame hug this into our W and again let's what I'm actually W and again let's what I'm actually W and again let's what I'm actually going to do is disconnect it the W here going to do is disconnect it the W here going to do is disconnect it the W here on our riff just so we can see what the on our riff just so we can see what the on our riff just so we can see what the lead guitar is lead guitar is lead guitar is [Music] doing so our lead guitar is now controlling the now controlling the now controlling the noise of noise of noise of this so now we have our lead guitar set this so now we have our lead guitar set this so now we have our lead guitar set up next we want our up next we want our up next we want our drums so again we can do duplicate all drums so again we can do duplicate all drums so again we can do duplicate all of these of these of these nodes rename this to nodes rename this to nodes rename this to drum I to add key frame channels need to drum I to add key frame channels need to drum I to add key frame channels need to make sure that the uh node is actually make sure that the uh node is actually make sure that the uh node is actually selected sounds to samples we'll select selected sounds to samples we'll select selected sounds to samples we'll select our drums and on this one I actually do our drums and on this one I actually do our drums and on this one I actually do want to change the frequency range want to change the frequency range want to change the frequency range because what I would like is the the because what I would like is the the because what I would like is the the pulsing motion that we want to add on pulsing motion that we want to add on pulsing motion that we want to add on every drum beat I want that to be every drum beat I want that to be every drum beat I want that to be stronger for the symbols so when the stronger for the symbols so when the stronger for the symbols so when the symbols are hitting it's symbols are hitting it's symbols are hitting it's pulsing uh in a bigger way than just the pulsing uh in a bigger way than just the pulsing uh in a bigger way than just the kick drum so I'm going to change that kick drum so I'm going to change that kick drum so I'm going to change that from 0 to 100,000 to I think 5,000 to from 0 to 100,000 to I think 5,000 to from 0 to 100,000 to I think 5,000 to 10,000 and these are in 10,000 and these are in 10,000 and these are in kilohertz sound samples and you can see kilohertz sound samples and you can see kilohertz sound samples and you can see we've got we've got we've got our audio here it's obviously very um our audio here it's obviously very um our audio here it's obviously very um like the size of the values is quite like the size of the values is quite like the size of the values is quite small because we've isolated those frame small because we've isolated those frame small because we've isolated those frame ranges um if I was to redo that and just ranges um if I was to redo that and just ranges um if I was to redo that and just set those back to the set those back to the set those back to the defaults defaults defaults so0 to whatever the default was or so0 to whatever the default was or so0 to whatever the default was or 100,000 the audio for the drums now on 100,000 the audio for the drums now on 100,000 the audio for the drums now on the default values is obviously a lot the default values is obviously a lot the default values is obviously a lot stronger but that's not what we want on stronger but that's not what we want on stronger but that's not what we want on this specific occasion so set that back this specific occasion so set that back this specific occasion so set that back to 5,000 10,000 and you'll see now that we've got 10,000 and you'll see now that we've got 10,000 and you'll see now that we've got these different spikes for our Kick Drum these different spikes for our Kick Drum these different spikes for our Kick Drum and then as we look over here these are and then as we look over here these are and then as we look over here these are going to be our symbol crashes so our going to be our symbol crashes so our going to be our symbol crashes so our symbols are going to be a lot stronger symbols are going to be a lot stronger symbols are going to be a lot stronger than our Kick Drum which is exactly what than our Kick Drum which is exactly what than our Kick Drum which is exactly what we want I'm going to need to multiply we want I'm going to need to multiply we want I'm going to need to multiply this up quite a lot uh potentially by this up quite a lot uh potentially by this up quite a lot uh potentially by 10 plug this into the W and for remember 10 plug this into the W and for remember 10 plug this into the W and for remember we said that we need to change the we said that we need to change the we said that we need to change the negative of our scale here so I actually negative of our scale here so I actually negative of our scale here so I actually don't need to use my audio buffer for don't need to use my audio buffer for don't need to use my audio buffer for that can just take another multiply node that can just take another multiply node that can just take another multiply node hook the drums straight into it and we hook the drums straight into it and we hook the drums straight into it and we can do it by negative 10 because we need can do it by negative 10 because we need can do it by negative 10 because we need to make sure we're going in the negative to make sure we're going in the negative to make sure we're going in the negative Direction hook this up to the scale of Direction hook this up to the scale of Direction hook this up to the scale of our noise our noise our noise drum so now as we again if I drum so now as we again if I drum so now as we again if I disconnect the disconnect the disconnect the um the guitars so we're not going to see um the guitars so we're not going to see um the guitars so we're not going to see any of the Distortion we're just looking any of the Distortion we're just looking any of the Distortion we're just looking at what the drum is doing so that's becoming a lot stronger doing so that's becoming a lot stronger doing so that's becoming a lot stronger compared to uh just the where it's compared to uh just the where it's compared to uh just the where it's pulsing on the kick pulsing on the kick pulsing on the kick drum so now if we hook all these back up drum so now if we hook all these back up drum so now if we hook all these back up together add these back into the W go to together add these back into the W go to together add these back into the W go to the start and we can see what this looks the start and we can see what this looks the start and we can see what this looks like in like in like in [Music] total so yeah it's looking pretty total so yeah it's looking pretty total so yeah it's looking pretty decent oh thank decent oh thank decent oh thank [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] you so next we want to there's going to you so next we want to there's going to you so next we want to there's going to be a bit of kind of data wrangling in be a bit of kind of data wrangling in be a bit of kind of data wrangling in this next bit um so if I lose anybody this next bit um so if I lose anybody this next bit um so if I lose anybody with some of the math if I haven't lost with some of the math if I haven't lost with some of the math if I haven't lost half of you already um I apologize and half of you already um I apologize and half of you already um I apologize and please feel free to to ask later on uh please feel free to to ask later on uh please feel free to to ask later on uh any questions that you might have uh so any questions that you might have uh so any questions that you might have uh so what we now want is that uh n That B what we now want is that uh n That B what we now want is that uh n That B value where we're equal to our noise value where we're equal to our noise value where we're equal to our noise where we're choosing the selection of where we're choosing the selection of where we're choosing the selection of our color I want that to be dependent on our color I want that to be dependent on our color I want that to be dependent on the drum beat so I'm going to get I'm the drum beat so I'm going to get I'm the drum beat so I'm going to get I'm going to reduplicate that and this one I going to reduplicate that and this one I going to reduplicate that and this one I am going to use just the default drum am going to use just the default drum am going to use just the default drum values so we can key frame it Channel s values so we can key frame it Channel s values so we can key frame it Channel s samples take our drums we'll reset these samples take our drums we'll reset these samples take our drums we'll reset these to our to our to our defaults so we've got these big spikes defaults so we've got these big spikes defaults so we've got these big spikes which is every drum and symbol beat and which is every drum and symbol beat and which is every drum and symbol beat and what I would like is that after every what I would like is that after every what I would like is that after every drum beat we randomize the color that is drum beat we randomize the color that is drum beat we randomize the color that is selected selected selected so how do we do that we're going to use so how do we do that we're going to use so how do we do that we're going to use our node Group which I should really our node Group which I should really our node Group which I should really name we'll call name we'll call name we'll call this audio buffer let's duplicate our this audio buffer let's duplicate our this audio buffer let's duplicate our audio audio audio buffer We'll add our drum beat into this buffer We'll add our drum beat into this buffer We'll add our drum beat into this and we're going to use uh this and we're going to use uh this and we're going to use uh this simulation Zone to be able to track when simulation Zone to be able to track when simulation Zone to be able to track when our data is at a certain value our data is at a certain value our data is at a certain value in My Graph I'm going to untick uh the in My Graph I'm going to untick uh the in My Graph I'm going to untick uh the only show selected so I can see all of only show selected so I can see all of only show selected so I can see all of my audio files here um and also the one my audio files here um and also the one my audio files here um and also the one thing that actually just as a small thing that actually just as a small thing that actually just as a small gripe uh while I've got a platform for gripe uh while I've got a platform for gripe uh while I've got a platform for it I'm it really annoys me that you it I'm it really annoys me that you it I'm it really annoys me that you can't rename these default like the can't rename these default like the can't rename these default like the names of like the default value in the names of like the default value in the names of like the default value in the graph editor if anybody knows how to do graph editor if anybody knows how to do graph editor if anybody knows how to do that or if there's any devs watching that or if there's any devs watching that or if there's any devs watching that know would would like to try and that know would would like to try and that know would would like to try and fix that please that would be great um fix that please that would be great um fix that please that would be great um I'm going to turn those off though for I'm going to turn those off though for I'm going to turn those off though for these ones so we just want to isolate these ones so we just want to isolate these ones so we just want to isolate our drum Meats I'm also going to just our drum Meats I'm also going to just our drum Meats I'm also going to just add a rot node here and view oh in fact add a rot node here and view oh in fact add a rot node here and view oh in fact I won't do that just yet what I want to I won't do that just yet what I want to I won't do that just yet what I want to do is to control that b value from do is to control that b value from do is to control that b value from inside of my audio buffer so just like inside of my audio buffer so just like inside of my audio buffer so just like we did with the accumulated out output we did with the accumulated out output we did with the accumulated out output I'm going to sample another one I'm going to sample another one I'm going to sample another one duplicate the wrong things there named duplicate the wrong things there named duplicate the wrong things there named attribute and Sample index and I'm going attribute and Sample index and I'm going attribute and Sample index and I'm going to call to call to call this selection we'll hook this one up to our selection we'll hook this one up to our selection we'll hook this one up to our outputs and we'll rename it and we can hook our it and we can hook our it and we can hook our selection up to that b selection up to that b selection up to that b value so obviously we don't yet have a value so obviously we don't yet have a value so obviously we don't yet have a selection attribute so let's create one selection attribute so let's create one selection attribute so let's create one store end store end store end attribute call it selection so now as I attribute call it selection so now as I attribute call it selection so now as I change this value we're change this value we're change this value we're changing the color selection and I'm changing the color selection and I'm changing the color selection and I'm going to use random value just between going to use random value just between going to use random value just between zero and one we can hook this up and now zero and one we can hook this up and now zero and one we can hook this up and now we have a we have a we have a seed that as we change our seed value seed that as we change our seed value seed that as we change our seed value we're changing the different color we're changing the different color we're changing the different color selection selection selection just like we've already been doing with just like we've already been doing with just like we've already been doing with named attributes we're going to use named attributes we're going to use named attributes we're going to use another one and we're going to call this another one and we're going to call this another one and we're going to call this seed and we'll hook this up to our seed seed and we'll hook this up to our seed seed and we'll hook this up to our seed and I think this needs to be an and I think this needs to be an and I think this needs to be an integer and again we can now store the integer and again we can now store the integer and again we can now store the named attribute make this an attribute make this an attribute make this an integer seed so now when we change this integer seed so now when we change this integer seed so now when we change this seed seed seed here our colors are changing so how can we change our seed changing so how can we change our seed changing so how can we change our seed value based on our audio well what I'm value based on our audio well what I'm value based on our audio well what I'm going to do is again we're going to need going to do is again we're going to need going to do is again we're going to need two more attributes going to call this one attributes going to call this one attributes going to call this one um f for frame that's fine and it's um f for frame that's fine and it's um f for frame that's fine and it's going to be a Boolean value so what we going to be a Boolean value so what we going to be a Boolean value so what we can say is that with our can say is that with our can say is that with our audio when our audio is equal to a audio when our audio is equal to a audio when our audio is equal to a certain value certain value certain value it's either going to be true or false it's either going to be true or false it's either going to be true or false and that value and the Epsilon is going and that value and the Epsilon is going and that value and the Epsilon is going to be a value based on our wave on our to be a value based on our wave on our to be a value based on our wave on our audio here so I'm thinking when it gets audio here so I'm thinking when it gets audio here so I'm thinking when it gets to like this zero when it hits the to like this zero when it hits the to like this zero when it hits the bottom of these spikes that's when I bottom of these spikes that's when I bottom of these spikes that's when I want my seed to change we also need to want my seed to change we also need to want my seed to change we also need to make sure that we add a bit of a Epsilon make sure that we add a bit of a Epsilon make sure that we add a bit of a Epsilon because it doesn't quite reach zero on because it doesn't quite reach zero on because it doesn't quite reach zero on the symbol values where the this is the symbol values where the this is the symbol values where the this is where the symbols are hitting and it's where the symbols are hitting and it's where the symbols are hitting and it's not quite reaching zero so if we say not quite reaching zero so if we say not quite reaching zero so if we say zero with an Epsilon of 0.1 and hook this up to our value and 0.1 and hook this up to our value and 0.1 and hook this up to our value and now what I'm going to do is just view now what I'm going to do is just view now what I'm going to do is just view our point so just need to keep an eye on our point so just need to keep an eye on our point so just need to keep an eye on the uh the spreadsheet you're not going the uh the spreadsheet you're not going the uh the spreadsheet you're not going to see anything in the uh the viewport to see anything in the uh the viewport to see anything in the uh the viewport for the moment but now so our F for the moment but now so our F for the moment but now so our F attribute is true because the value is attribute is true because the value is attribute is true because the value is at zero and as I scroll at zero and as I scroll at zero and as I scroll up up up with true false with true false with true false true false true Etc so we've now got a true false true Etc so we've now got a true false true Etc so we've now got a Boolean Boolean Boolean value that we can use as a switch there value that we can use as a switch there value that we can use as a switch there is one problem though this value this is one problem though this value this is one problem though this value this Boolean value of f is currently true Boolean value of f is currently true Boolean value of f is currently true for 1 2 3 4 four five six like six for 1 2 3 4 four five six like six for 1 2 3 4 four five six like six frames if we were to use that to change frames if we were to use that to change frames if we were to use that to change the seed it's going to mean that the the seed it's going to mean that the the seed it's going to mean that the color is going to change six times in color is going to change six times in color is going to change six times in six frames and I don't want to give six frames and I don't want to give six frames and I don't want to give anybody an epileptic fit so instead what anybody an epileptic fit so instead what anybody an epileptic fit so instead what we can we can we can do is we're going to add one last do is we're going to add one last do is we're going to add one last attribute again it's going to be a attribute again it's going to be a attribute again it's going to be a Boolean value and it's going to be F Boolean value and it's going to be F Boolean value and it's going to be F minus minus minus one and the value one and the value one and the value is just going to be F so every is just going to be F so every is just going to be F so every time delete time delete time delete that select the correct one there we go that select the correct one there we go that select the correct one there we go so now when I go back to the start f is so now when I go back to the start f is so now when I go back to the start f is true and F minus one is false on the true and F minus one is false on the true and F minus one is false on the second second second frame f is false but F minus one is now frame f is false but F minus one is now frame f is false but F minus one is now true because this is now the value of true because this is now the value of true because this is now the value of what F was on the previous frame so by what F was on the previous frame so by what F was on the previous frame so by doing this we're able to now track doing this we're able to now track doing this we're able to now track when our dat when our value changes the when our dat when our value changes the when our dat when our value changes the first time so we can say that when f is first time so we can say that when f is first time so we can say that when f is true so as we go up they're both false true so as we go up they're both false true so as we go up they're both false now but now we've just hit that point now but now we've just hit that point now but now we've just hit that point where we want our color to change f is where we want our color to change f is where we want our color to change f is true and F minus one is false so we can true and F minus one is false so we can true and F minus one is false so we can just do a little bit of Boolean math just do a little bit of Boolean math just do a little bit of Boolean math take both of our take both of our take both of our attributes so when f attributes so when f attributes so when f is equal to one or is equal to one or is equal to one or true and F minus one is equal to zero so true and F minus one is equal to zero so true and F minus one is equal to zero so it's it's it's false we're going to add a bullan math false we're going to add a bullan math false we're going to add a bullan math node and say that when both of these are node and say that when both of these are node and say that when both of these are true this is now giving me a switch change it to an integer this is switch change it to an integer this is switch change it to an integer this is now a switch that I can use to add to my now a switch that I can use to add to my now a switch that I can use to add to my seed so when that's false it's going to seed so when that's false it's going to seed so when that's false it's going to be zero when it's true it's going to be be zero when it's true it's going to be be zero when it's true it's going to be one so we're going to add one to our one so we're going to add one to our one so we're going to add one to our seed make a little bit more seed make a little bit more seed make a little bit more room we can add room we can add room we can add these to our seed attribute just like we these to our seed attribute just like we these to our seed attribute just like we did with the did with the did with the accumulated and add this together so now accumulated and add this together so now accumulated and add this together so now as I go back to the start we have a seed as I go back to the start we have a seed as I go back to the start we have a seed of one and a selection of of one and a selection of of one and a selection of 0.295 as I go 0.295 as I go 0.295 as I go up our seed has now changed as as our up our seed has now changed as as our up our seed has now changed as as our selection value selection value selection value when we hit the next one our seed when we hit the next one our seed when we hit the next one our seed changes changes changes again keep going so on and so forth so again keep going so on and so forth so again keep going so on and so forth so now if I get rid of my viewer node this now if I get rid of my viewer node this now if I get rid of my viewer node this should in [Music] theory means that our color is also theory means that our color is also theory means that our color is also changing that's pretty much it I mean the the that's pretty much it I mean the the that's pretty much it I mean the the thing here is this is a relatively thing here is this is a relatively thing here is this is a relatively simple example um to be honest it's only simple example um to be honest it's only simple example um to be honest it's only a couple of different noise textures um a couple of different noise textures um a couple of different noise textures um you know you could make these as complex you know you could make these as complex you know you could make these as complex as you wanted you could add more noise as you wanted you could add more noise as you wanted you could add more noise textures you could do lots of different textures you could do lots of different textures you could do lots of different things with it um I've got a couple of things with it um I've got a couple of things with it um I've got a couple of different examples here of I don't say different examples here of I don't say different examples here of I don't say accident to be fine demo plane is this accident to be fine demo plane is this accident to be fine demo plane is this one so I've got another example oo that one so I've got another example oo that one so I've got another example oo that was way too loud so I've got a similar thing here loud so I've got a similar thing here loud so I've got a similar thing here where instead of it being on a um just

we use for the Jacob colia project where we use for the Jacob colia project where we use for the Jacob colia project where we used we separated that head into used we separated that head into used we separated that head into different colored different colored different colored collections um and we were able to use collections um and we were able to use collections um and we were able to use the exact same uh kind of techniques to the exact same uh kind of techniques to the exact same uh kind of techniques to be able to to do the Jacob colia stuff be able to to do the Jacob colia stuff be able to to do the Jacob colia stuff um just looking at the time looks like um just looking at the time looks like um just looking at the time looks like I'm doing pretty good uh so yeah that's I'm doing pretty good uh so yeah that's I'm doing pretty good uh so yeah that's it for me if anybody has any questions it for me if anybody has any questions it for me if anybody has any questions feel free to ask thank you [Applause] uh does anybody have any questions Y is uh does anybody have any questions Y is uh does anybody have any questions Y is it possible to do it with audio pardon it possible to do it with audio pardon it possible to do it with audio pardon sorry is it possible to do it with light sorry is it possible to do it with light sorry is it possible to do it with light AIO as AIO as AIO as um I'm answer that is I'm not sure to be um I'm answer that is I'm not sure to be um I'm answer that is I'm not sure to be perfectly honest I'm sure it probably is perfectly honest I'm sure it probably is perfectly honest I'm sure it probably is but you need to get some way of bringing but you need to get some way of bringing but you need to get some way of bringing the audio directly in to blender I'm not the audio directly in to blender I'm not the audio directly in to blender I'm not I'm not sure how you do that um but I I'm not sure how you do that um but I I'm not sure how you do that um but I mean all of this is based on kind of a mean all of this is based on kind of a mean all of this is based on kind of a key on key frames basically uh on a key on key frames basically uh on a key on key frames basically uh on a value that's being tracked from uh like value that's being tracked from uh like value that's being tracked from uh like a soundwave so if you're able to get a soundwave so if you're able to get a soundwave so if you're able to get that into blender then yes but I don't that into blender then yes but I don't that into blender then yes but I don't know how to do that need to be sampled know how to do that need to be sampled know how to do that need to be sampled as well yeah exactly it would need to be as well yeah exactly it would need to be as well yeah exactly it would need to be sampled live yeah any other sampled live yeah any other sampled live yeah any other questions no great thank you questions no great thank you questions no great thank you [Applause]
