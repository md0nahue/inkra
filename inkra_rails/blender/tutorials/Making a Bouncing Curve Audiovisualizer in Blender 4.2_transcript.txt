Kind: captions Language: en in this tutorial we're going to make a in this tutorial we're going to make a in this tutorial we're going to make a glowing object Bounce from point to glowing object Bounce from point to glowing object Bounce from point to point and every time it jumps it plays a point and every time it jumps it plays a point and every time it jumps it plays a note so what's happening under the hood note so what's happening under the hood note so what's happening under the hood here is that we're making a vector here is that we're making a vector here is that we're making a vector object follow a predetermined path object follow a predetermined path object follow a predetermined path playing a predetermined song and it's playing a predetermined song and it's playing a predetermined song and it's one of those Concepts where it's really one of those Concepts where it's really one of those Concepts where it's really easy to visualize in your mind what you easy to visualize in your mind what you easy to visualize in your mind what you want to achieve but as you probably want to achieve but as you probably want to achieve but as you probably might know it can be a bit tricky to might know it can be a bit tricky to might know it can be a bit tricky to make Curves in blender behave as you make Curves in blender behave as you make Curves in blender behave as you intended so I made a free add-on to Sol intended so I made a free add-on to Sol intended so I made a free add-on to Sol this problem and I'm going to show you this problem and I'm going to show you this problem and I'm going to show you how you can make this glowing object how you can make this glowing object how you can make this glowing object play any song you can think of using play any song you can think of using play any song you can think of using only free and open Source software so only free and open Source software so only free and open Source software so here we are in blender version 4.2 and here we are in blender version 4.2 and here we are in blender version 4.2 and we're going to start out by deleting we're going to start out by deleting we're going to start out by deleting everything and making a curve bzier so everything and making a curve bzier so everything and making a curve bzier so this curve is going to be our projectile this curve is going to be our projectile this curve is going to be our projectile or the energy trail that is traveling or the energy trail that is traveling or the energy trail that is traveling through our music so I'm going to press through our music so I'm going to press through our music so I'm going to press f2 and rename this to projectile and f2 and rename this to projectile and f2 and rename this to projectile and then we're going to give this some then we're going to give this some then we're going to give this some thickness by going to object data thickness by going to object data thickness by going to object data properties and under geometry you can properties and under geometry you can properties and under geometry you can increase the bevel increase the bevel increase the bevel depth but we don't want the curve to depth but we don't want the curve to depth but we don't want the curve to swing like this we want it to be swing like this we want it to be swing like this we want it to be perfectly straight so let's press tab to perfectly straight so let's press tab to perfectly straight so let's press tab to go to edit mode and then let's press V go to edit mode and then let's press V go to edit mode and then let's press V to set the handle type to automatic so to set the handle type to automatic so to set the handle type to automatic so now when you go back to object mode we now when you go back to object mode we now when you go back to object mode we want this curve to be shaped like a want this curve to be shaped like a want this curve to be shaped like a projectile like this so it's like a drop projectile like this so it's like a drop projectile like this so it's like a drop of water or this energy trail that is of water or this energy trail that is of water or this energy trail that is traveling this way so to make that shape traveling this way so to make that shape traveling this way so to make that shape let's go shift a and let's make another let's go shift a and let's make another let's go shift a and let's make another bzier curve and let's call this taper so bzier curve and let's call this taper so bzier curve and let's call this taper so now let's select our projectile curve now let's select our projectile curve now let's select our projectile curve and under geometry you can set the taper and under geometry you can set the taper and under geometry you can set the taper object to be this new curve and now if object to be this new curve and now if object to be this new curve and now if you increase the depth all the way up to you increase the depth all the way up to you increase the depth all the way up to one you can select the the taper and in one you can select the the taper and in one you can select the the taper and in edit mode you can select these control edit mode you can select these control edit mode you can select these control points and you can see that we are points and you can see that we are points and you can see that we are controlling the shape of this so I want controlling the shape of this so I want controlling the shape of this so I want our projectile to be moving this way so our projectile to be moving this way so our projectile to be moving this way so let's make this perfectly thin you can let's make this perfectly thin you can let's make this perfectly thin you can hold on control and rotate it so it's hold on control and rotate it so it's hold on control and rotate it so it's perfectly aligned with the grid and then perfectly aligned with the grid and then perfectly aligned with the grid and then let's change the shape let's change the shape let's change the shape here and I want this to be like a round here and I want this to be like a round here and I want this to be like a round shape but you can see that we are shape but you can see that we are shape but you can see that we are limited by the poly count of our curve limited by the poly count of our curve limited by the poly count of our curve here so to increase the resolution of here so to increase the resolution of here so to increase the resolution of our projectile you can increase the our projectile you can increase the our projectile you can increase the resolution preview but now you can see that even though we but now you can see that even though we but now you can see that even though we have increased this to be a lot it's have increased this to be a lot it's have increased this to be a lot it's still low poly and that is because we still low poly and that is because we still low poly and that is because we also need to increase the resolution of also need to increase the resolution of also need to increase the resolution of the taper so let's select our taper and the taper so let's select our taper and the taper so let's select our taper and let's click and drag and increase this a let's click and drag and increase this a let's click and drag and increase this a little bit more so now we have a higher little bit more so now we have a higher little bit more so now we have a higher resolution projectile but if you view it resolution projectile but if you view it resolution projectile but if you view it from the side like this you can see that from the side like this you can see that from the side like this you can see that it's still low Poly on this angle so to it's still low Poly on this angle so to it's still low Poly on this angle so to fix this we can increase the bevel fix this we can increase the bevel fix this we can increase the bevel resolution and what's really powerful resolution and what's really powerful resolution and what's really powerful about the workflow we're doing today is about the workflow we're doing today is about the workflow we're doing today is that this is a completely that this is a completely that this is a completely non-destructive workflow so at any point non-destructive workflow so at any point non-destructive workflow so at any point if something is lagging in your viewport if something is lagging in your viewport if something is lagging in your viewport or something like that you can always or something like that you can always or something like that you can always change the resolution preview without change the resolution preview without change the resolution preview without changing the behavior of our animation changing the behavior of our animation changing the behavior of our animation okay so let's tweak this shape a little okay so let's tweak this shape a little okay so let's tweak this shape a little bit more I think it's too thick so let's bit more I think it's too thick so let's bit more I think it's too thick so let's just lower the bevel depth a little bit just lower the bevel depth a little bit just lower the bevel depth a little bit and then I want it to be a little bit and then I want it to be a little bit and then I want it to be a little bit rounder at the edge so to do this we can rounder at the edge so to do this we can rounder at the edge so to do this we can select the projectile press tab to go to select the projectile press tab to go to select the projectile press tab to go to edit mode right click subdivide and now edit mode right click subdivide and now edit mode right click subdivide and now we have a new control point in the we have a new control point in the we have a new control point in the center here so let's press G and X to center here so let's press G and X to center here so let's press G and X to move it on the x-axis and now you can move it on the x-axis and now you can move it on the x-axis and now you can see we can change the weight of this a see we can change the weight of this a see we can change the weight of this a little bit and then let's take this little bit and then let's take this little bit and then let's take this point to the tip and let's scale this point to the tip and let's scale this point to the tip and let's scale this down so now we have a beautiful shape down so now we have a beautiful shape down so now we have a beautiful shape that is a little bit of a head over here that is a little bit of a head over here that is a little bit of a head over here and then it's a little bit thinner back and then it's a little bit thinner back and then it's a little bit thinner back here which I think is really cool but here which I think is really cool but here which I think is really cool but feel free to make whatever shape you feel free to make whatever shape you feel free to make whatever shape you like Okay so let's give this projectile like Okay so let's give this projectile like Okay so let's give this projectile something to bounce between I want to go something to bounce between I want to go something to bounce between I want to go shift a and let's make a mesh plane and shift a and let's make a mesh plane and shift a and let's make a mesh plane and let's scale this down and I want to view let's scale this down and I want to view let's scale this down and I want to view this from above so let's press Z on this this from above so let's press Z on this this from above so let's press Z on this Gizmo you can also use npad 7 and now we Gizmo you can also use npad 7 and now we Gizmo you can also use npad 7 and now we want to just make a bunch of copies of want to just make a bunch of copies of want to just make a bunch of copies of this so let's press shift d and move it this so let's press shift d and move it this so let's press shift d and move it over there shift over there shift over there shift another one and I want to do some another one and I want to do some another one and I want to do some jumpings where it's first it's close and jumpings where it's first it's close and jumpings where it's first it's close and then it's far away so let's just make a then it's far away so let's just make a then it's far away so let's just make a bunch of copies let's make it go back bunch of copies let's make it go back bunch of copies let's make it go back and forth a little and forth a little and forth a little bit and now we want to make this bounce bit and now we want to make this bounce bit and now we want to make this bounce in between these in between these in between these points and to make this trajectory a points and to make this trajectory a points and to make this trajectory a little bit natural I want the trajectory little bit natural I want the trajectory little bit natural I want the trajectory of the longer distances to be a higher of the longer distances to be a higher of the longer distances to be a higher bounce and I want the short distances to bounce and I want the short distances to bounce and I want the short distances to be a lower bounce and you might be be a lower bounce and you might be be a lower bounce and you might be thinking well that's just something you thinking well that's just something you thinking well that's just something you could figure out with math I guess right could figure out with math I guess right could figure out with math I guess right and uh yes you are right so I met an and uh yes you are right so I met an and uh yes you are right so I met an add-on to do this and it's actually not add-on to do this and it's actually not add-on to do this and it's actually not an add-on you even need to download if an add-on you even need to download if an add-on you even need to download if you are in blunder version 4.2 you can you are in blunder version 4.2 you can you are in blunder version 4.2 you can simply select all these objects and you simply select all these objects and you simply select all these objects and you can go F4 preferences and in the get can go F4 preferences and in the get can go F4 preferences and in the get extensions tab you can just search for extensions tab you can just search for extensions tab you can just search for simple bounce curve and there you can simple bounce curve and there you can simple bounce curve and there you can see there is my extension and if you see there is my extension and if you see there is my extension and if you click install you have the add-on click install you have the add-on click install you have the add-on installed that is so cool so the installed that is so cool so the installed that is so cool so the extension platforms on blender is really extension platforms on blender is really extension platforms on blender is really nice so so with the addon installed nice so so with the addon installed nice so so with the addon installed select all the objects you want to make select all the objects you want to make select all the objects you want to make a bounce curve in between and let's go a bounce curve in between and let's go a bounce curve in between and let's go object and then you can click this new object and then you can click this new object and then you can click this new button which is called create bounce button which is called create bounce button which is called create bounce curve so now we have this curve that is curve so now we have this curve that is curve so now we have this curve that is bouncing in between these objects to bouncing in between these objects to bouncing in between these objects to make our energy Trail follow this curve make our energy Trail follow this curve make our energy Trail follow this curve I think I want to scale it down a little I think I want to scale it down a little I think I want to scale it down a little bit actually so let's select the taper bit actually so let's select the taper bit actually so let's select the taper curve and the projectile curve and just curve and the projectile curve and just curve and the projectile curve and just scale this down by pressing scale this down by pressing scale this down by pressing s and then once you have scaled them s and then once you have scaled them s and then once you have scaled them down make sure you go contr a apply down make sure you go contr a apply down make sure you go contr a apply scale so to make our curve follow the scale so to make our curve follow the scale so to make our curve follow the path let's select our projectile let's path let's select our projectile let's path let's select our projectile let's go to modify properties add modifier go to modify properties add modifier go to modify properties add modifier deform curve and then you set the curve deform curve and then you set the curve deform curve and then you set the curve object to be our new simple bounce object to be our new simple bounce object to be our new simple bounce curve now if you select your projectile curve now if you select your projectile curve now if you select your projectile you can press G and you can just move you can press G and you can just move you can press G and you can just move your cursor and you can see that it's your cursor and you can see that it's your cursor and you can see that it's bouncing but it's a little bit something bouncing but it's a little bit something bouncing but it's a little bit something is off here right and the problem is is off here right and the problem is is off here right and the problem is that when we are moving it right now that when we are moving it right now that when we are moving it right now we're moving it on all the axis actually we're moving it on all the axis actually we're moving it on all the axis actually on the x-axis and the y- axis and the on the x-axis and the y- axis and the on the x-axis and the y- axis and the z-axis but if you lock the Y and z-axis z-axis but if you lock the Y and z-axis z-axis but if you lock the Y and z-axis now you can press G and move it and it now you can press G and move it and it now you can press G and move it and it will only move on the x-axis and it is will only move on the x-axis and it is will only move on the x-axis and it is looking a lot better but there's one looking a lot better but there's one looking a lot better but there's one thing I don't really like about this I thing I don't really like about this I thing I don't really like about this I don't think these trajectories look don't think these trajectories look don't think these trajectories look super realistic I don't want it to be super realistic I don't want it to be super realistic I don't want it to be like this I want it to be more like this like this I want it to be more like this like this I want it to be more like this like an even Arc so what we want to do like an even Arc so what we want to do like an even Arc so what we want to do is that we want to do changes to our is that we want to do changes to our is that we want to do changes to our curve but we want to do all the changes curve but we want to do all the changes curve but we want to do all the changes in batch so we don't want to press tab in batch so we don't want to press tab in batch so we don't want to press tab to go to edit mode and then kind of to go to edit mode and then kind of to go to edit mode and then kind of tweak this individually and then this tweak this individually and then this tweak this individually and then this one and then this one because that is one and then this one because that is one and then this one because that is extremely timec consuming we want to extremely timec consuming we want to extremely timec consuming we want to make sure that every operation we're make sure that every operation we're make sure that every operation we're doing to this curve is being done to the doing to this curve is being done to the doing to this curve is being done to the entire curve so no matter how long your entire curve so no matter how long your entire curve so no matter how long your bounce path is it will work so select bounce path is it will work so select bounce path is it will work so select your path press tab to go to edit mode your path press tab to go to edit mode your path press tab to go to edit mode and then press a to select all of the and then press a to select all of the and then press a to select all of the points and then you want to hold down points and then you want to hold down points and then you want to hold down shift and select one of the points so shift and select one of the points so shift and select one of the points so it's kind of like highlighted like this it's kind of like highlighted like this it's kind of like highlighted like this so it's like a white you see these white so it's like a white you see these white so it's like a white you see these white things because if you don't do that this things because if you don't do that this things because if you don't do that this next thing won't work so we're going to next thing won't work so we're going to next thing won't work so we're going to go F3 and search for check your deselect go F3 and search for check your deselect go F3 and search for check your deselect and now you can see that we have and now you can see that we have and now you can see that we have selected only the bottom points and you selected only the bottom points and you selected only the bottom points and you can bring up this little menu I can can bring up this little menu I can can bring up this little menu I can offset it by one offset it by one offset it by one and now we have all these top points and now we have all these top points and now we have all these top points selected so since this curve is selected so since this curve is selected so since this curve is alternating between bouncing and you alternating between bouncing and you alternating between bouncing and you know flying in the air we can use this know flying in the air we can use this know flying in the air we can use this technique to very easily select only the technique to very easily select only the technique to very easily select only the top points of the curve so now that top points of the curve so now that top points of the curve so now that these are selected we can increase the these are selected we can increase the these are selected we can increase the scale but if you just press s and scale scale but if you just press s and scale scale but if you just press s and scale it up it doesn't really work we have to it up it doesn't really work we have to it up it doesn't really work we have to change the transform Pivot Point to change the transform Pivot Point to change the transform Pivot Point to individual Origins and now you can press individual Origins and now you can press individual Origins and now you can press s and you can scale this up and look at s and you can scale this up and look at s and you can scale this up and look at that we have a much more natural that we have a much more natural that we have a much more natural trajectory and if you want to change the trajectory and if you want to change the trajectory and if you want to change the curve height you can reset the position curve height you can reset the position curve height you can reset the position of the 3D cursor by pressing shift C and of the 3D cursor by pressing shift C and of the 3D cursor by pressing shift C and then you can set the transform Pivot then you can set the transform Pivot then you can set the transform Pivot Point to 3D cursor so now when you press Point to 3D cursor so now when you press Point to 3D cursor so now when you press s and Z you can scale this up on the s and Z you can scale this up on the s and Z you can scale this up on the z-axis so it's bouncing a little bit z-axis so it's bouncing a little bit z-axis so it's bouncing a little bit higher or lower and then you can change higher or lower and then you can change higher or lower and then you can change it back to individual Origins if you it back to individual Origins if you it back to individual Origins if you like and tweak a little bit more okay so like and tweak a little bit more okay so like and tweak a little bit more okay so I'm happy about the bounce trajectory I'm happy about the bounce trajectory I'm happy about the bounce trajectory but I don't want the curve to start in but I don't want the curve to start in but I don't want the curve to start in the ground here I want it to start the ground here I want it to start the ground here I want it to start somewhere over here and bounce down and somewhere over here and bounce down and somewhere over here and bounce down and then it starts bouncing so to do this then it starts bouncing so to do this then it starts bouncing so to do this let's select our bounce path let's press let's select our bounce path let's press let's select our bounce path let's press tab to go edit mode and you want to tab to go edit mode and you want to tab to go edit mode and you want to select this point right here but you select this point right here but you select this point right here but you cannot select this by pressing click and cannot select this by pressing click and cannot select this by pressing click and select because these are multiple points select because these are multiple points select because these are multiple points so you will mess it up so you can click so you will mess it up so you can click so you will mess it up so you can click and drag to box select so now you have and drag to box select so now you have and drag to box select so now you have the entire thing selected so now you can the entire thing selected so now you can the entire thing selected so now you can press e to extrude this and then let's press e to extrude this and then let's press e to extrude this and then let's press e to extrude it once more let's press e to extrude it once more let's press e to extrude it once more let's click and drag both of these and then go click and drag both of these and then go click and drag both of these and then go V and set the handle type to automatic V and set the handle type to automatic V and set the handle type to automatic and then if you like you can rotate this and then if you like you can rotate this and then if you like you can rotate this a little bit Yeah so now let's animate a little bit Yeah so now let's animate a little bit Yeah so now let's animate our projectile let's press K to insert a our projectile let's press K to insert a our projectile let's press K to insert a location key for and then let's zoom out location key for and then let's zoom out location key for and then let's zoom out so we can see everything and then let's so we can see everything and then let's so we can see everything and then let's go all the way to frame 250 and now you go all the way to frame 250 and now you go all the way to frame 250 and now you can press G and you can move your cursor can press G and you can move your cursor can press G and you can move your cursor all the way around you can see it's all the way around you can see it's all the way around you can see it's bouncing around like that really cool bouncing around like that really cool bouncing around like that really cool and then when we get to the end there we and then when we get to the end there we and then when we get to the end there we want to overshoot it a little bit like want to overshoot it a little bit like want to overshoot it a little bit like this and then let's go k for insert key this and then let's go k for insert key this and then let's go k for insert key frame menu and then click location so frame menu and then click location so frame menu and then click location so now we have an animation of a bouncing now we have an animation of a bouncing now we have an animation of a bouncing curve look at curve look at curve look at that so you probably notice that it that so you probably notice that it that so you probably notice that it starts out slow and then it goes faster starts out slow and then it goes faster starts out slow and then it goes faster and faster and that is because blender's and faster and that is because blender's and faster and that is because blender's default key frame interpolation is beier default key frame interpolation is beier default key frame interpolation is beier but you want it to be linear so if you but you want it to be linear so if you but you want it to be linear so if you want to see what it looks like you can want to see what it looks like you can want to see what it looks like you can just pull this up and press control Tab just pull this up and press control Tab just pull this up and press control Tab and then you can zoom out there and now and then you can zoom out there and now and then you can zoom out there and now you can see that this is our key frame you can see that this is our key frame you can see that this is our key frame graph but we want this to be linear so graph but we want this to be linear so graph but we want this to be linear so simply press T and let's set it to simply press T and let's set it to simply press T and let's set it to linear interpolation so now it will go linear interpolation so now it will go linear interpolation so now it will go at the same speed so let's press control at the same speed so let's press control at the same speed so let's press control tab to go back to the timeline view and tab to go back to the timeline view and tab to go back to the timeline view and let's bring this back down you know I'm let's bring this back down you know I'm let's bring this back down you know I'm so happy about this effect it just feels so happy about this effect it just feels so happy about this effect it just feels so organic when this is just bouncing in so organic when this is just bouncing in so organic when this is just bouncing in between the objects like this so I between the objects like this so I between the objects like this so I actually recommend that you experiment actually recommend that you experiment actually recommend that you experiment with this because this is a lot more use with this because this is a lot more use with this because this is a lot more use cases than just visualizing music one cases than just visualizing music one cases than just visualizing music one thing I've been using it for is to do thing I've been using it for is to do thing I've been using it for is to do stylized map animations for example stylized map animations for example stylized map animations for example which becomes really easy with this which becomes really easy with this which becomes really easy with this add-on but how do we make this bouncing add-on but how do we make this bouncing add-on but how do we make this bouncing effect line up with the music now this effect line up with the music now this effect line up with the music now this is where things get a little bit more is where things get a little bit more is where things get a little bit more interesting because you could just interesting because you could just interesting because you could just import any audio file and start lining import any audio file and start lining import any audio file and start lining it up with the waveform Peaks so the it up with the waveform Peaks so the it up with the waveform Peaks so the x-axis would be the note timing and the x-axis would be the note timing and the x-axis would be the note timing and the y- axis would be the pitch of the note y- axis would be the pitch of the note y- axis would be the pitch of the note and eventually you would probably get a and eventually you would probably get a and eventually you would probably get a satisfying result however if you can satisfying result however if you can satisfying result however if you can create your music digitally you can create your music digitally you can create your music digitally you can export it as a midi file which is a export it as a midi file which is a export it as a midi file which is a format that contains a ton of format that contains a ton of format that contains a ton of information about the notes that were information about the notes that were information about the notes that were played like their velocity timing and played like their velocity timing and played like their velocity timing and Pitch which is exactly what we want okay Pitch which is exactly what we want okay Pitch which is exactly what we want okay so to record some Medi music we can use so to record some Medi music we can use so to record some Medi music we can use this fully open source online media this fully open source online media this fully open source online media editor which is signal. versal doapp I'm editor which is signal. versal doapp I'm editor which is signal. versal doapp I'm just going to click launch and here you just going to click launch and here you just going to click launch and here you can simply just add a note and then you can simply just add a note and then you can simply just add a note and then you can add another one and a third one and can add another one and a third one and can add another one and a third one and you can basically just play any music you can basically just play any music you can basically just play any music that you want okay so this is the old Russian want okay so this is the old Russian want okay so this is the old Russian folk song called kurin Niki you might folk song called kurin Niki you might folk song called kurin Niki you might have heard it have heard it have heard it [Music] before so once you have the song you can before so once you have the song you can before so once you have the song you can change the sound if you change the sound if you change the sound if you like but I'm just going to go for a like but I'm just going to go for a like but I'm just going to go for a default acoustic grand piano so to save default acoustic grand piano so to save default acoustic grand piano so to save this as a Medi file let's go file save this as a Medi file let's go file save this as a Medi file let's go file save and in addition to the media file we and in addition to the media file we and in addition to the media file we also want to export this as an audio also want to export this as an audio also want to export this as an audio file so let's go file export audio let's file so let's go file export audio let's file so let's go file export audio let's just click export so here we have our m just click export so here we have our m just click export so here we have our m file and our wave file and we can listen file and our wave file and we can listen file and our wave file and we can listen to our wave file but we can't really do to our wave file but we can't really do to our wave file but we can't really do much with the midi file in Blender at much with the midi file in Blender at much with the midi file in Blender at least but we know it contains all the least but we know it contains all the least but we know it contains all the data and we know what we want to do with data and we know what we want to do with data and we know what we want to do with the data remember we just want the the data remember we just want the the data remember we just want the x-axis to show the note timing and the x-axis to show the note timing and the x-axis to show the note timing and the y- axis to show the pitch of the note y- axis to show the pitch of the note y- axis to show the pitch of the note and then we'd like this to be imported and then we'd like this to be imported and then we'd like this to be imported to blender as objects that we can select to blender as objects that we can select to blender as objects that we can select you know like an SVG file that would be you know like an SVG file that would be you know like an SVG file that would be perfect so what we really want is a tool perfect so what we really want is a tool perfect so what we really want is a tool that can read the mid data and render it that can read the mid data and render it that can read the mid data and render it like we specify on the X and y- AIS and like we specify on the X and y- AIS and like we specify on the X and y- AIS and allow us to save that as an VG image allow us to save that as an VG image allow us to save that as an VG image perfect let's just tell chat GPT to do perfect let's just tell chat GPT to do perfect let's just tell chat GPT to do that and it works so this tool can run that and it works so this tool can run that and it works so this tool can run in a browser it's up on my website in a browser it's up on my website in a browser it's up on my website pure.com you can find it by just pure.com you can find it by just pure.com you can find it by just clicking on this slider and dragging clicking on this slider and dragging clicking on this slider and dragging until it says BR and then you click the until it says BR and then you click the until it says BR and then you click the third o like that okay there it is yeah third o like that okay there it is yeah third o like that okay there it is yeah so here's the simple midi to SVG so here's the simple midi to SVG so here's the simple midi to SVG converter you can just click browse and converter you can just click browse and converter you can just click browse and then let's select your midi file click then let's select your midi file click then let's select your midi file click open and there you can see it's bum bum open and there you can see it's bum bum open and there you can see it's bum bum bum it is our midi file as an SVG so bum it is our midi file as an SVG so bum it is our midi file as an SVG so let's just click download as VG so in let's just click download as VG so in let's just click download as VG so in blender I'm going to delete this blender I'm going to delete this blender I'm going to delete this previous stuff I'm just going to keep previous stuff I'm just going to keep previous stuff I'm just going to keep our projectile like that and then let's our projectile like that and then let's our projectile like that and then let's go F4 import scalable vector graphics go F4 import scalable vector graphics go F4 import scalable vector graphics SVG and then going to find our file SVG and then going to find our file SVG and then going to find our file click import and it might look like click import and it might look like click import and it might look like nothing happened but it's actually there nothing happened but it's actually there nothing happened but it's actually there you just have to zoom in because it's you just have to zoom in because it's you just have to zoom in because it's really really tiny so let's just click really really tiny so let's just click really really tiny so let's just click and select all of these and let's press and select all of these and let's press and select all of these and let's press s to scale it up and I want to scale it s to scale it up and I want to scale it s to scale it up and I want to scale it up a lot up a lot up a lot actually and now let's move it over here actually and now let's move it over here actually and now let's move it over here so now we have these points that will so now we have these points that will so now we have these points that will match our music and just a quick note match our music and just a quick note match our music and just a quick note and this is actually a really quick note and this is actually a really quick note and this is actually a really quick note sorry uh you can probably tell that this sorry uh you can probably tell that this sorry uh you can probably tell that this looks different than in the music looks different than in the music looks different than in the music visualizers I've been sharing on visualizers I've been sharing on visualizers I've been sharing on Instagram and that's because these use Instagram and that's because these use Instagram and that's because these use actual sheet music which is pretty cool actual sheet music which is pretty cool actual sheet music which is pretty cool if you're into that but it takes a bit if you're into that but it takes a bit if you're into that but it takes a bit longer to set up so we're keeping it longer to set up so we're keeping it longer to set up so we're keeping it simple in this tutorial but if you want simple in this tutorial but if you want simple in this tutorial but if you want to learn the longer process of how to do to learn the longer process of how to do to learn the longer process of how to do this with accurate sheet music there's this with accurate sheet music there's this with accurate sheet music there's going to be more information about that going to be more information about that going to be more information about that at the end of this video okay so let's at the end of this video okay so let's at the end of this video okay so let's make this bouncing curve in between make this bouncing curve in between make this bouncing curve in between these objects so select all of them and these objects so select all of them and these objects so select all of them and now we're going to use this create now we're going to use this create now we're going to use this create bounce curve add-on but you will quickly bounce curve add-on but you will quickly bounce curve add-on but you will quickly notice that if you try to use this it notice that if you try to use this it notice that if you try to use this it just doesn't work look at that just just doesn't work look at that just just doesn't work look at that just nothing happens and that is because this nothing happens and that is because this nothing happens and that is because this add-on uses the origin of the object so add-on uses the origin of the object so add-on uses the origin of the object so by default all SVG files are sharing the by default all SVG files are sharing the by default all SVG files are sharing the same origin like right over there same origin like right over there same origin like right over there because we mov it there we want this to because we mov it there we want this to because we mov it there we want this to have individual Origins so with all have individual Origins so with all have individual Origins so with all these notes selected you want to go these notes selected you want to go these notes selected you want to go right click set origin to geometry and right click set origin to geometry and right click set origin to geometry and now you can see you have these uh now you can see you have these uh now you can see you have these uh correct Origins so now you can select correct Origins so now you can select correct Origins so now you can select all of them and you can go object create all of them and you can go object create all of them and you can go object create bounce curve and there is our beautiful bounce curve and there is our beautiful bounce curve and there is our beautiful curve and now as the last time I want to curve and now as the last time I want to curve and now as the last time I want to change these bounce trajectories to be a change these bounce trajectories to be a change these bounce trajectories to be a little bit more organic so select all of little bit more organic so select all of little bit more organic so select all of them let's just do the Checker D select them let's just do the Checker D select them let's just do the Checker D select individual Origins let's scale this individual Origins let's scale this individual Origins let's scale this up yeah that's good and then I also want up yeah that's good and then I also want up yeah that's good and then I also want this to start a little bit like this yeah okay so let's visualize this this yeah okay so let's visualize this this yeah okay so let's visualize this music so let's take our projectile and music so let's take our projectile and music so let's take our projectile and let's go to the modifier properties you let's go to the modifier properties you let's go to the modifier properties you can see we already have the curve can see we already have the curve can see we already have the curve modifier so let's just set that to be modifier so let's just set that to be modifier so let's just set that to be the simple bounce curve oh and we the simple bounce curve oh and we the simple bounce curve oh and we actually also still have the actually also still have the actually also still have the animation okay so what we're going to do animation okay so what we're going to do animation okay so what we're going to do now is that we're going to sync this up now is that we're going to sync this up now is that we're going to sync this up so every time it bounces it plays the so every time it bounces it plays the so every time it bounces it plays the correct note and to make life a lot correct note and to make life a lot correct note and to make life a lot easier for ourself we're going to import easier for ourself we're going to import easier for ourself we're going to import the audio file to blender so let's just the audio file to blender so let's just the audio file to blender so let's just bring this up a little bit and let's go bring this up a little bit and let's go bring this up a little bit and let's go right click horizontal split and let's right click horizontal split and let's right click horizontal split and let's just click here and now you can set this just click here and now you can set this just click here and now you can set this editor type to video sequencer and now editor type to video sequencer and now editor type to video sequencer and now to import the audio simply hold your to import the audio simply hold your to import the audio simply hold your mouse here and go shift a and let's go mouse here and go shift a and let's go mouse here and go shift a and let's go sound and let's find our wave file that sound and let's find our wave file that sound and let's find our wave file that we exported add sound strip and now if we exported add sound strip and now if we exported add sound strip and now if you press you press you press play you can hear the sound file and play you can hear the sound file and play you can hear the sound file and that's good but we want to see it as that's good but we want to see it as that's good but we want to see it as well so you can use this little handles well so you can use this little handles well so you can use this little handles here to zoom in and we can zoom in here here to zoom in and we can zoom in here here to zoom in and we can zoom in here as well and then you want to press n to as well and then you want to press n to as well and then you want to press n to bring up this little menu here and then bring up this little menu here and then bring up this little menu here and then you can um enable the display waveform you can um enable the display waveform you can um enable the display waveform so now we can actually see our audio and so now we can actually see our audio and so now we can actually see our audio and then you can increase the volume also then you can increase the volume also then you can increase the volume also just make sure it doesn't go red because just make sure it doesn't go red because just make sure it doesn't go red because then it's peeking okay that's good so then it's peeking okay that's good so then it's peeking okay that's good so now when you press play you can see the now when you press play you can see the now when you press play you can see the music okay so first of all you can see music okay so first of all you can see music okay so first of all you can see that the projectile is jumping a little that the projectile is jumping a little that the projectile is jumping a little bit before it hits so we want to start bit before it hits so we want to start bit before it hits so we want to start it when it's here we don't want to start it when it's here we don't want to start it when it's here we don't want to start right at frame one so we need to offset right at frame one so we need to offset right at frame one so we need to offset the music just a little bit so we can the music just a little bit so we can the music just a little bit so we can see that it's nine frames right so let's see that it's nine frames right so let's see that it's nine frames right so let's select this sound clip and let's press G select this sound clip and let's press G select this sound clip and let's press G and then X and then you can move it all and then X and then you can move it all and then X and then you can move it all the way over here so now when you press the way over here so now when you press the way over here so now when you press play the first note is synced up but if play the first note is synced up but if play the first note is synced up but if you let this keep you let this keep you let this keep playing it just not synced at all so had playing it just not synced at all so had playing it just not synced at all so had this been a 2d effect we would have been this been a 2d effect we would have been this been a 2d effect we would have been able to just give this a linear amount able to just give this a linear amount able to just give this a linear amount of speed and it could just go like this of speed and it could just go like this of speed and it could just go like this and all the notes would sync up but and all the notes would sync up but and all the notes would sync up but since we are working in 3D here not only since we are working in 3D here not only since we are working in 3D here not only do we have this distance in between the do we have this distance in between the do we have this distance in between the notes we also have this distance which notes we also have this distance which notes we also have this distance which varies from note to note so it's not varies from note to note so it's not varies from note to note so it's not that easy to fully automate this but I'm that easy to fully automate this but I'm that easy to fully automate this but I'm going to show you a really nice way going to show you a really nice way going to show you a really nice way where you can just manually tweak it so where you can just manually tweak it so where you can just manually tweak it so every note hits perfectly every time so every note hits perfectly every time so every note hits perfectly every time so we're going to split our viewport in we're going to split our viewport in we're going to split our viewport in half so let's right click on this line half so let's right click on this line half so let's right click on this line and let's go vertical split and let's and let's go vertical split and let's and let's go vertical split and let's set this editor type to graph editor and set this editor type to graph editor and set this editor type to graph editor and let's press n to bring away this menu let's press n to bring away this menu let's press n to bring away this menu and now here you can see we have our and now here you can see we have our and now here you can see we have our curve so now if you view this from the curve so now if you view this from the curve so now if you view this from the front by pressing minus y on this Gizmo front by pressing minus y on this Gizmo front by pressing minus y on this Gizmo now you can see we have this really nice now you can see we have this really nice now you can see we have this really nice view from the front there so what we are view from the front there so what we are view from the front there so what we are going to do we're going to be moving going to do we're going to be moving going to do we're going to be moving through this timeline and every time we through this timeline and every time we through this timeline and every time we can see that there's a note hit you can can see that there's a note hit you can can see that there's a note hit you can increase this to make it a little bit increase this to make it a little bit increase this to make it a little bit easier to see every time we see that easier to see every time we see that easier to see every time we see that there's a note hit we're going to make there's a note hit we're going to make there's a note hit we're going to make sure that that is the correct bounce and sure that that is the correct bounce and sure that that is the correct bounce and this might sound horrible but it's this might sound horrible but it's this might sound horrible but it's actually really fast to do because we actually really fast to do because we actually really fast to do because we are going to be using something that is are going to be using something that is are going to be using something that is called automatic keying so simply enable called automatic keying so simply enable called automatic keying so simply enable the automatic keying and you go to the the automatic keying and you go to the the automatic keying and you go to the first one and you can hear this okay first one and you can hear this okay first one and you can hear this okay that sounds correct oh by the way if you that sounds correct oh by the way if you that sounds correct oh by the way if you go to playback you can enable scrubbing go to playback you can enable scrubbing go to playback you can enable scrubbing so now you can hear the music when so now you can hear the music when so now you can hear the music when you're scrubbing so here you can see we you're scrubbing so here you can see we you're scrubbing so here you can see we have the first bounce and then over have the first bounce and then over have the first bounce and then over there and then here we have the second there and then here we have the second there and then here we have the second bounce so now you can simply press G and bounce so now you can simply press G and bounce so now you can simply press G and you can move it there and look here we you can move it there and look here we you can move it there and look here we just Auto automatically made a key frame just Auto automatically made a key frame just Auto automatically made a key frame because we have the auto keying on so because we have the auto keying on so because we have the auto keying on so now let's move to the next now let's move to the next now let's move to the next note which is this one which starts here note which is this one which starts here note which is this one which starts here you can see then you can just press G you can see then you can just press G you can see then you can just press G and you can move it so it's kind of and you can move it so it's kind of and you can move it so it's kind of wrinkling like this it looks a little wrinkling like this it looks a little wrinkling like this it looks a little bit disgusting but then you know it's bit disgusting but then you know it's bit disgusting but then you know it's actually bouncing and now you can see we actually bouncing and now you can see we actually bouncing and now you can see we are creating these key frames here so are creating these key frames here so are creating these key frames here so now let's go to the next one okay that's now let's go to the next one okay that's now let's go to the next one okay that's good and now let's press G and let's good and now let's press G and let's good and now let's press G and let's move this back and by the way if you move this back and by the way if you move this back and by the way if you didn't have any key frames you might didn't have any key frames you might didn't have any key frames you might experience that it's not moving forward experience that it's not moving forward experience that it's not moving forward if you just playing it like this and if you just playing it like this and if you just playing it like this and that's okay because what you can do you that's okay because what you can do you that's okay because what you can do you can select your key frames pressing a to can select your key frames pressing a to can select your key frames pressing a to select all the key frames and now you select all the key frames and now you select all the key frames and now you can go shift e and you can go linear can go shift e and you can go linear can go shift e and you can go linear extrapolation so now you can see that extrapolation so now you can see that extrapolation so now you can see that blender is extrapolating the last key blender is extrapolating the last key blender is extrapolating the last key frame which makes this a lot easier to frame which makes this a lot easier to frame which makes this a lot easier to do so now let's zoom out and play this do so now let's zoom out and play this do so now let's zoom out and play this from the beginning here you can from the beginning here you can from the beginning here you can see oh it's actually almost perfectly see oh it's actually almost perfectly see oh it's actually almost perfectly lined up with this one and let's move it lined up with this one and let's move it lined up with this one and let's move it there next note there yeah and then sometimes it's just yeah and then sometimes it's just yeah and then sometimes it's just perfectly lined up but I like to just perfectly lined up but I like to just perfectly lined up but I like to just add a key frame there anyways and then if you like you can anyways and then if you like you can anyways and then if you like you can skip forward many frames like this go to skip forward many frames like this go to skip forward many frames like this go to this one and then you can go back and this one and then you can go back and this one and then you can go back and kind of just make sure that they're kind of just make sure that they're kind of just make sure that they're perfectly lined perfectly lined perfectly lined up and then this is a long up and then this is a long up and then this is a long one and there we go oh I forgot to make it bounce one last oh I forgot to make it bounce one last oh I forgot to make it bounce one last time at the end here so let's select our time at the end here so let's select our time at the end here so let's select our path and let's press tab to go to edit path and let's press tab to go to edit path and let's press tab to go to edit mode you want to box select the last mode you want to box select the last mode you want to box select the last control Point press e to extrude and control Point press e to extrude and control Point press e to extrude and then let's do e for another one now you then let's do e for another one now you then let's do e for another one now you can box select these two and press V and can box select these two and press V and can box select these two and press V and set the handle type to automatic so now set the handle type to automatic so now set the handle type to automatic so now it will kind of Bounce one last it will kind of Bounce one last it will kind of Bounce one last time and one important note is that you time and one important note is that you time and one important note is that you can always add extra stuff to the end of can always add extra stuff to the end of can always add extra stuff to the end of the animation and it will not mess it up the animation and it will not mess it up the animation and it will not mess it up but if you go to the beginning of the but if you go to the beginning of the but if you go to the beginning of the animation you can't really do any animation you can't really do any animation you can't really do any changes because if you do a change here changes because if you do a change here changes because if you do a change here then that change is offset and will mess then that change is offset and will mess then that change is offset and will mess up your entire animation okay let's have up your entire animation okay let's have up your entire animation okay let's have a look at what we got a look at what we got a look at what we got [Music] there okay so if I'm viewing this from there okay so if I'm viewing this from there okay so if I'm viewing this from here right now you can see it pretty here right now you can see it pretty here right now you can see it pretty quickly gets really small and difficult quickly gets really small and difficult quickly gets really small and difficult to see what's happening over there so I to see what's happening over there so I to see what's happening over there so I want to make a camera that is following want to make a camera that is following want to make a camera that is following the motion like the motion like the motion like this so let's go shift a and let's make this so let's go shift a and let's make this so let's go shift a and let's make a camera you want to just look at this a camera you want to just look at this a camera you want to just look at this from the angle where you want the camera from the angle where you want the camera from the angle where you want the camera to be placed so I think maybe this is to be placed so I think maybe this is to be placed so I think maybe this is good and then let's select the camera good and then let's select the camera good and then let's select the camera let's go view align view align camera to let's go view align view align camera to let's go view align view align camera to view which is control alt number at zero view which is control alt number at zero view which is control alt number at zero so now you can scroll to zoom in and so now you can scroll to zoom in and so now you can scroll to zoom in and then you can right click and you can then you can right click and you can then you can right click and you can adjust the focal length to zoom the adjust the focal length to zoom the adjust the focal length to zoom the camera out a little camera out a little camera out a little bit and with the camera selected you can bit and with the camera selected you can bit and with the camera selected you can press G and you can move it down for for press G and you can move it down for for press G and you can move it down for for example or you can press R and rotate example or you can press R and rotate example or you can press R and rotate and frame your shot so I'm going to and frame your shot so I'm going to and frame your shot so I'm going to press R and then X and then X again so press R and then X and then X again so press R and then X and then X again so we're tilting the camera down so now we're tilting the camera down so now we're tilting the camera down so now when we press play this just starts when we press play this just starts when we press play this just starts moving and we want the camera to just moving and we want the camera to just moving and we want the camera to just follow this so select the camera and follow this so select the camera and follow this so select the camera and press K to insert a key frame let's go press K to insert a key frame let's go press K to insert a key frame let's go location and then let's move forward location and then let's move forward location and then let's move forward until it's out of the camera and then until it's out of the camera and then until it's out of the camera and then let's press G and then X because we're let's press G and then X because we're let's press G and then X because we're moving on the xaxis and then let's move moving on the xaxis and then let's move moving on the xaxis and then let's move to we can see it again there it is and to we can see it again there it is and to we can see it again there it is and let's press K and insert a location key let's press K and insert a location key let's press K and insert a location key frame so now the camera is following it frame so now the camera is following it frame so now the camera is following it but it's following it too fast and this but it's following it too fast and this but it's following it too fast and this is the same issue that we had earlier is the same issue that we had earlier is the same issue that we had earlier that the default key frame interpolation that the default key frame interpolation that the default key frame interpolation is beier so make sure your camera is is beier so make sure your camera is is beier so make sure your camera is selected and then you press a to select selected and then you press a to select selected and then you press a to select all the key frames and then press shift all the key frames and then press shift all the key frames and then press shift e and select linear extrapolation and e and select linear extrapolation and e and select linear extrapolation and now you can see not only do you have now you can see not only do you have now you can see not only do you have this linear graph where the camera is this linear graph where the camera is this linear graph where the camera is following it you can also add key frames following it you can also add key frames following it you can also add key frames so if you select this last key frame so if you select this last key frame so if you select this last key frame here and go shift d you can duplicate it here and go shift d you can duplicate it here and go shift d you can duplicate it so this just makes it really easy to so this just makes it really easy to so this just makes it really easy to tweak this okay so we need to move it up tweak this okay so we need to move it up tweak this okay so we need to move it up a little bit okay nice so we have our a little bit okay nice so we have our a little bit okay nice so we have our camera that is following this animation camera that is following this animation camera that is following this animation let's add some materials to make this let's add some materials to make this let's add some materials to make this look a little bit more interesting so look a little bit more interesting so look a little bit more interesting so first of all I want to go to render first of all I want to go to render first of all I want to go to render properties and I want to set the render properties and I want to set the render properties and I want to set the render engine to cycles and then let's set our engine to cycles and then let's set our engine to cycles and then let's set our viewport shading to rendered and then if viewport shading to rendered and then if viewport shading to rendered and then if you like you can make some more room you like you can make some more room you like you can make some more room here so you can just right click join here so you can just right click join here so you can just right click join areas and click on one you want to areas and click on one you want to areas and click on one you want to remove and now here we are in the render remove and now here we are in the render remove and now here we are in the render View and this looks quite boring because View and this looks quite boring because View and this looks quite boring because it's not really that much here yet so we it's not really that much here yet so we it's not really that much here yet so we want to change the material of the want to change the material of the want to change the material of the projectile so let's go to material projectile so let's go to material projectile so let's go to material properties and let's give it a new properties and let's give it a new properties and let's give it a new material by clicking new and let's call material by clicking new and let's call material by clicking new and let's call this energy Trail I want to change the this energy Trail I want to change the this energy Trail I want to change the surface from Principal bstf to emission surface from Principal bstf to emission surface from Principal bstf to emission and now we want to add a ground plane so and now we want to add a ground plane so and now we want to add a ground plane so let's press shift C to make sure that let's press shift C to make sure that let's press shift C to make sure that our 3D cursor is at the center of our our 3D cursor is at the center of our our 3D cursor is at the center of our seam let's press shift a and let's make seam let's press shift a and let's make seam let's press shift a and let's make a plane and now you press s to scale a plane and now you press s to scale a plane and now you press s to scale this up and want to zoom in on these this up and want to zoom in on these this up and want to zoom in on these notes and want to press G and Z to move notes and want to press G and Z to move notes and want to press G and Z to move it a little bit down on the z-axis so we it a little bit down on the z-axis so we it a little bit down on the z-axis so we get this cool little Shadow effect on get this cool little Shadow effect on get this cool little Shadow effect on our notes and now to view this from the our notes and now to view this from the our notes and now to view this from the camera again you can click this camera camera again you can click this camera camera again you can click this camera on or numpad zero so now you can see on or numpad zero so now you can see on or numpad zero so now you can see that this energy Trail material is that this energy Trail material is that this energy Trail material is lighting up our ground and we can lighting up our ground and we can lighting up our ground and we can increase the strength to emphasize this increase the strength to emphasize this increase the strength to emphasize this effect even effect even effect even more so let's set this to 15 for example more so let's set this to 15 for example more so let's set this to 15 for example okay so now let's give our ground plane okay so now let's give our ground plane okay so now let's give our ground plane a little bit more of an interesting a little bit more of an interesting a little bit more of an interesting Shader so let's select our ground plane Shader so let's select our ground plane Shader so let's select our ground plane and let's make a new material and let's and let's make a new material and let's and let's make a new material and let's call this ground plane and I want to set call this ground plane and I want to set call this ground plane and I want to set the surface Shader to mix Shader and I the surface Shader to mix Shader and I the surface Shader to mix Shader and I want to set the top Shader to diffuse want to set the top Shader to diffuse want to set the top Shader to diffuse and then the lower Shader to glossy and and then the lower Shader to glossy and and then the lower Shader to glossy and then you can lower the roughness of the then you can lower the roughness of the then you can lower the roughness of the glossy so now you can see the reflection glossy so now you can see the reflection glossy so now you can see the reflection of our energy Trail here and you can of our energy Trail here and you can of our energy Trail here and you can make it a little bit darker and then we can tweak this darker and then we can tweak this darker and then we can tweak this grayness and now to get some more grayness and now to get some more grayness and now to get some more contrast in our scene let's go to World contrast in our scene let's go to World contrast in our scene let's go to World Properties and let's set the surface Properties and let's set the surface Properties and let's set the surface strength to zero oh I think we need to strength to zero oh I think we need to strength to zero oh I think we need to change this a little bit okay nice but I change this a little bit okay nice but I change this a little bit okay nice but I think I want some color on this energy think I want some color on this energy think I want some color on this energy Trail so select your projectile and in Trail so select your projectile and in Trail so select your projectile and in the material properties let's click this the material properties let's click this the material properties let's click this color and let's give this a yellow color and let's give this a yellow color and let's give this a yellow material for example yeah I think that's material for example yeah I think that's material for example yeah I think that's cool you know what if I disable overlay cool you know what if I disable overlay cool you know what if I disable overlay now and I look through the animation now and I look through the animation now and I look through the animation it's a little bit difficult to see that it's a little bit difficult to see that it's a little bit difficult to see that we're going forward so to emphasize the we're going forward so to emphasize the we're going forward so to emphasize the motion that we are actually traveling motion that we are actually traveling motion that we are actually traveling through this world I want to add some through this world I want to add some through this world I want to add some lights so let's go shift a and let's lights so let's go shift a and let's lights so let's go shift a and let's make a light area light and you want to make a light area light and you want to make a light area light and you want to press G and Z to move this up a little press G and Z to move this up a little press G and Z to move this up a little bit you can see you get this beautiful bit you can see you get this beautiful bit you can see you get this beautiful soft light I want to move this a little soft light I want to move this a little soft light I want to move this a little bit on the Y AIS and if you want to move bit on the Y AIS and if you want to move bit on the Y AIS and if you want to move it around more easily you can click this it around more easily you can click this it around more easily you can click this move icon here so now you can click this move icon here so now you can click this move icon here so now you can click this Arrow Arrow Arrow instead yeah and I think I want to place instead yeah and I think I want to place instead yeah and I think I want to place it it it there yeah maybe a little bit lower so there yeah maybe a little bit lower so there yeah maybe a little bit lower so I'm going to press G and move it on the I'm going to press G and move it on the I'm going to press G and move it on the z-axis but one thing that is bothering z-axis but one thing that is bothering z-axis but one thing that is bothering me a little bit is that we can see the me a little bit is that we can see the me a little bit is that we can see the reflection of this light and I only want reflection of this light and I only want reflection of this light and I only want to have this really soft diffuse to have this really soft diffuse to have this really soft diffuse interaction with the lighting so to fix interaction with the lighting so to fix interaction with the lighting so to fix this we can simply select our light and this we can simply select our light and this we can simply select our light and under object properties you can go down under object properties you can go down under object properties you can go down to visibility and you can disable the to visibility and you can disable the to visibility and you can disable the aray visibility for the glossiness so aray visibility for the glossiness so aray visibility for the glossiness so now this light is not reflecting any now this light is not reflecting any now this light is not reflecting any light but it's still lighting up the light but it's still lighting up the light but it's still lighting up the diffus part of the material which I just diffus part of the material which I just diffus part of the material which I just think looks a lot better because it was think looks a lot better because it was think looks a lot better because it was a little bit distracting with this a little bit distracting with this a little bit distracting with this reflection here so now let's just reflection here so now let's just reflection here so now let's just duplicate this light a bunch of times duplicate this light a bunch of times duplicate this light a bunch of times let's go alt D to duplicate linked in let's go alt D to duplicate linked in let's go alt D to duplicate linked in case you want to do changes to the light case you want to do changes to the light case you want to do changes to the light later and let's press X to specify the later and let's press X to specify the later and let's press X to specify the x-axis and I think this is a good x-axis and I think this is a good x-axis and I think this is a good distance and then without doing anything distance and then without doing anything distance and then without doing anything else you can press shift R to repeat else you can press shift R to repeat else you can press shift R to repeat that action I I think that's too much let's action I I think that's too much let's action I I think that's too much let's get rid of this one and then this one get rid of this one and then this one get rid of this one and then this one okay so now let's view this from the okay so now let's view this from the okay so now let's view this from the camera view yeah I think I like that by the way view yeah I think I like that by the way view yeah I think I like that by the way if you want to isolate what the camera if you want to isolate what the camera if you want to isolate what the camera is seeing you can press contrl B and is seeing you can press contrl B and is seeing you can press contrl B and just click and drag like this and now we just click and drag like this and now we just click and drag like this and now we are only rendering what's inside the are only rendering what's inside the are only rendering what's inside the camera border I think maybe the ground camera border I think maybe the ground camera border I think maybe the ground is a little bit too bright so let's go is a little bit too bright so let's go is a little bit too bright so let's go to the material properties and let's to the material properties and let's to the material properties and let's lower the diffuse strength here oh by lower the diffuse strength here oh by lower the diffuse strength here oh by the way one thing I completely forgot the way one thing I completely forgot the way one thing I completely forgot about you see these things here these about you see these things here these about you see these things here these SVG files that we imported these are SVG files that we imported these are SVG files that we imported these are actually curve objects if you select all actually curve objects if you select all actually curve objects if you select all of them so in the corini collection you of them so in the corini collection you of them so in the corini collection you can just select this one and hold on can just select this one and hold on can just select this one and hold on shift and then select all the way down shift and then select all the way down shift and then select all the way down to curve 18 so now all of these are to curve 18 so now all of these are to curve 18 so now all of these are selected and they are the only thing selected and they are the only thing selected and they are the only thing that are selected you can press tab to that are selected you can press tab to that are selected you can press tab to go to edit mode a to select all the go to edit mode a to select all the go to edit mode a to select all the control points and you can press V and control points and you can press V and control points and you can press V and change the handle type to automatic change the handle type to automatic change the handle type to automatic because since these are curves we can because since these are curves we can because since these are curves we can still change the design of these so now still change the design of these so now still change the design of these so now we have these round notes instead which we have these round notes instead which we have these round notes instead which could look better if that's a that could look better if that's a that could look better if that's a that you're into yeah I think I like that you're into yeah I think I like that you're into yeah I think I like that better actually okay so let's export better actually okay so let's export better actually okay so let's export this as the video file and what's really this as the video file and what's really this as the video file and what's really interesting is that since we already interesting is that since we already interesting is that since we already have this audio file in the blunder have this audio file in the blunder have this audio file in the blunder project file we can export this video project file we can export this video project file we can export this video with the audio so we don't really have with the audio so we don't really have with the audio so we don't really have to use any more editing software we can to use any more editing software we can to use any more editing software we can just do everything from blunder so let's just do everything from blunder so let's just do everything from blunder so let's go to the output properties and under go to the output properties and under go to the output properties and under output you can change the file format I output you can change the file format I output you can change the file format I think the default is PNG you want to think the default is PNG you want to think the default is PNG you want to change it to FFM video and if you keep change it to FFM video and if you keep change it to FFM video and if you keep scrolling down you can see under scrolling down you can see under scrolling down you can see under encoding you want to change the encoding you want to change the encoding you want to change the container from mosa to ig4 four and then container from mosa to ig4 four and then container from mosa to ig4 four and then you want to change the output quality you want to change the output quality you want to change the output quality from medium quality to high quality and from medium quality to high quality and from medium quality to high quality and under audio make sure the audio codec is under audio make sure the audio codec is under audio make sure the audio codec is not set to no audio I recommend that you not set to no audio I recommend that you not set to no audio I recommend that you set it to AAC and then these default set it to AAC and then these default set it to AAC and then these default settings are fine so I'm just going to settings are fine so I'm just going to settings are fine so I'm just going to render this to my desktop audio render this to my desktop audio render this to my desktop audio visualizer version one accept and then visualizer version one accept and then visualizer version one accept and then I'm just going to set the resolution to I'm just going to set the resolution to I'm just going to set the resolution to 50% so I don't have to wait forever and 50% so I don't have to wait forever and 50% so I don't have to wait forever and then in the render properties I want to then in the render properties I want to then in the render properties I want to set the max samples to I think 256 is set the max samples to I think 256 is set the max samples to I think 256 is good for this so let's just do a test good for this so let's just do a test good for this so let's just do a test render actually oh we forgot to add the render actually oh we forgot to add the render actually oh we forgot to add the glow so to add glow really fast really glow so to add glow really fast really glow so to add glow really fast really simple let's just simply go to simple let's just simply go to simple let's just simply go to compositing and let's click use nodes compositing and let's click use nodes compositing and let's click use nodes and let's just go shift a and let's add and let's just go shift a and let's add and let's just go shift a and let's add a filter glare node and I just like to a filter glare node and I just like to a filter glare node and I just like to set it to fog glow with a high quality set it to fog glow with a high quality set it to fog glow with a high quality and I like to set the mix to minus. n6 and I like to set the mix to minus. n6 and I like to set the mix to minus. n6 for example the threshold to zero and for example the threshold to zero and for example the threshold to zero and the size to 9 so now when we render this the size to 9 so now when we render this the size to 9 so now when we render this yeah now we have this glow effect that yeah now we have this glow effect that yeah now we have this glow effect that just makes this look a little bit just makes this look a little bit just makes this look a little bit brighter if you ask me okay so for the brighter if you ask me okay so for the brighter if you ask me okay so for the final render I like to have motion blur final render I like to have motion blur final render I like to have motion blur enabled but you should know that if you enabled but you should know that if you enabled but you should know that if you have the persistent data enabled that have the persistent data enabled that have the persistent data enabled that just completely breaks the motion blur just completely breaks the motion blur just completely breaks the motion blur for this effect so if you're rendering for this effect so if you're rendering for this effect so if you're rendering this with motion blur make sure that the this with motion blur make sure that the this with motion blur make sure that the persistent data is disabled so to render persistent data is disabled so to render persistent data is disabled so to render the video Let's Go render render animation okay so the render has animation okay so the render has animation okay so the render has finished let's have a look at the final finished let's have a look at the final finished let's have a look at the final result result result [Music] okay I changed my mind and did it in okay I changed my mind and did it in okay I changed my mind and did it in 100% resolution instead and I swwa the 100% resolution instead and I swwa the 100% resolution instead and I swwa the audio track to a real piano recording so audio track to a real piano recording so audio track to a real piano recording so you can
