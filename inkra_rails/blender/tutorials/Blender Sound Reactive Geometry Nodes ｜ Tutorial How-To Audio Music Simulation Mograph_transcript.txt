description now let's fire up blender and make some now let's fire up blender and make some now let's fire up blender and make some cool audio based animations cool audio based animations cool audio based animations this is Sylvie and this tutorial has the this is Sylvie and this tutorial has the this is Sylvie and this tutorial has the Sylvie seal of approval I am using Sylvie seal of approval I am using Sylvie seal of approval I am using blender 3.6.1 for this and the first blender 3.6.1 for this and the first blender 3.6.1 for this and the first thing of course we want to do is get the thing of course we want to do is get the thing of course we want to do is get the audio in but before that it's important audio in but before that it's important audio in but before that it's important to set the frame rate now we're going to to set the frame rate now we're going to to set the frame rate now we're going to do the same thing as in the demo we're do the same thing as in the demo we're do the same thing as in the demo we're gonna have the base the mid frequencies gonna have the base the mid frequencies gonna have the base the mid frequencies and then the high frequencies so we're and then the high frequencies so we're and then the high frequencies so we're going to use the cube for the base going to use the cube for the base going to use the cube for the base um let's add in an icosphere and a um let's add in an icosphere and a um let's add in an icosphere and a Taurus for the high frequencies Taurus for the high frequencies Taurus for the high frequencies so essentially what we're going to do is so essentially what we're going to do is so essentially what we're going to do is assign the the volume of our audio file assign the the volume of our audio file assign the the volume of our audio file the base part to the cube okay how do we the base part to the cube okay how do we the base part to the cube okay how do we do that so we go to let's go to do that so we go to let's go to do that so we go to let's go to animation animation animation and on frame one so this is important and on frame one so this is important and on frame one so this is important you have to go shift across the left greencast Keys showing here so shift greencast Keys showing here so shift greencast Keys showing here so shift cursor left takes you to frame one and cursor left takes you to frame one and cursor left takes you to frame one and on that frame one we're gonna insert a on that frame one we're gonna insert a on that frame one we're gonna insert a location iframe location iframe location iframe okay okay okay and then we're going to take the C and then we're going to take the C and then we're going to take the C location location location we can turn this into the graph editor we can turn this into the graph editor we can turn this into the graph editor for example and we're gonna take we for example and we're gonna take we for example and we're gonna take we don't need this we just want the C don't need this we just want the C don't need this we just want the C location on frame one and then we go to location on frame one and then we go to location on frame one and then we go to channel channel channel and here you can go bake a sound to F and here you can go bake a sound to F and here you can go bake a sound to F curves which is exactly what we want and curves which is exactly what we want and curves which is exactly what we want and then I take my desired music and in here then I take my desired music and in here then I take my desired music and in here is where basically the magic happens so is where basically the magic happens so is where basically the magic happens so for the base for the cube we only want for the base for the cube we only want for the base for the cube we only want the base and the base we're gonna take the base and the base we're gonna take the base and the base we're gonna take from frequency zero to 300 let's just do from frequency zero to 300 let's just do from frequency zero to 300 let's just do that and then big sound to F curve and that and then big sound to F curve and that and then big sound to F curve and you can see we have some stuff in here you can see we have some stuff in here you can see we have some stuff in here now of course this audio file is a now of course this audio file is a now of course this audio file is a longer longer longer so let's click normalize and let's see so let's click normalize and let's see so let's click normalize and let's see how long it is and then we're just going how long it is and then we're just going how long it is and then we're just going to drag our end frame out to cover the to drag our end frame out to cover the to drag our end frame out to cover the entire song entire song entire song now we can see here that there's now we can see here that there's now we can see here that there's basically almost no base in the basically almost no base in the basically almost no base in the beginning of this song and then there's beginning of this song and then there's beginning of this song and then there's some Kick Drum hits and then there's a some Kick Drum hits and then there's a some Kick Drum hits and then there's a quiet again now if I hit a space bar to quiet again now if I hit a space bar to quiet again now if I hit a space bar to play we can see our cube is moving and play we can see our cube is moving and play we can see our cube is moving and it's moving with the base part of our it's moving with the base part of our it's moving with the base part of our song and then when the bass song and then when the bass song and then when the bass kicks in we can see it's moving a lot kicks in we can see it's moving a lot kicks in we can see it's moving a lot more however we can't hear anything yet more however we can't hear anything yet more however we can't hear anything yet but we can fix that we can go to the but we can fix that we can go to the but we can fix that we can go to the video editing part of blender and bring video editing part of blender and bring video editing part of blender and bring in the same in the same in the same audio file audio file audio file plop that in where is it oh of course I plop that in where is it oh of course I plop that in where is it oh of course I wasn't on frame one now but that doesn't wasn't on frame one now but that doesn't wasn't on frame one now but that doesn't matter I can just go frame one move that matter I can just go frame one move that matter I can just go frame one move that to frame one and then go back to my to frame one and then go back to my to frame one and then go back to my animation and if I hit spacebar now animation and if I hit spacebar now animation and if I hit spacebar now um I hope you can hear it a little bit um I hope you can hear it a little bit um I hope you can hear it a little bit in the background I have the music in the background I have the music in the background I have the music playing and I can hear and see what's playing and I can hear and see what's playing and I can hear and see what's happening so as I said this is just the happening so as I said this is just the happening so as I said this is just the base you can see this is reacting really base you can see this is reacting really base you can see this is reacting really quite nicely to the base quite nicely to the base quite nicely to the base now let's do the same thing with the mid now let's do the same thing with the mid now let's do the same thing with the mid range so let's go back to frame one this range so let's go back to frame one this range so let's go back to frame one this is important because of the baking is important because of the baking is important because of the baking because it I think it starts on the because it I think it starts on the because it I think it starts on the frame that you're currently on and do frame that you're currently on and do frame that you're currently on and do you always want to be on frame one so you always want to be on frame one so you always want to be on frame one so they are they all line up okay so they are they all line up okay so they are they all line up okay so icosphere we need an location iframe icosphere we need an location iframe icosphere we need an location iframe we go to the C location a channel we go to the C location a channel we go to the C location a channel big sound take the same one and let's do big sound take the same one and let's do big sound take the same one and let's do 300 to I don't know let's do four 300 to I don't know let's do four 300 to I don't know let's do four thousand okay thousand okay thousand okay uh that will be the the mid-range uh uh that will be the the mid-range uh uh that will be the the mid-range uh part of part of part of the sound Spectrum the sound Spectrum the sound Spectrum pick that in okay so there is a lot more pick that in okay so there is a lot more pick that in okay so there is a lot more happening in the beginning here whereas happening in the beginning here whereas happening in the beginning here whereas there's almost no base okay looking good there's almost no base okay looking good there's almost no base okay looking good now let's do the high frequencies again now let's do the high frequencies again now let's do the high frequencies again frame one insert location frame one insert location frame one insert location go to the C location Channel go to the C location Channel go to the C location Channel big sound pick the sound and let's go big sound pick the sound and let's go big sound pick the sound and let's go from four thousand to 20K from four thousand to 20K from four thousand to 20K and that's it for the high frequencies and that's it for the high frequencies and that's it for the high frequencies all right so the it works oh let me say all right so the it works oh let me say all right so the it works oh let me say first first first and then let's go back to frame one hit and then let's go back to frame one hit and then let's go back to frame one hit spacebar spacebar spacebar okay so there's a lot happening in the okay so there's a lot happening in the okay so there's a lot happening in the mid range here a little bit in the high mid range here a little bit in the high mid range here a little bit in the high frequencies a little bit in the low frequencies a little bit in the low frequencies a little bit in the low frequencies but then when the bass comes frequencies but then when the bass comes frequencies but then when the bass comes in this is the base the high frequencies the high the high frequencies the high the high frequencies the high frequencies are always a bit tricky frequencies are always a bit tricky frequencies are always a bit tricky because there's not that much in the because there's not that much in the because there's not that much in the super high frequencies happening and super high frequencies happening and super high frequencies happening and they're always overlapping a lot with they're always overlapping a lot with they're always overlapping a lot with the mid but that's just how it is my the mid but that's just how it is my the mid but that's just how it is my name is Chris and I make free blender name is Chris and I make free blender name is Chris and I make free blender tutorials if you enjoy the content tutorials if you enjoy the content

thank you back to the tutorial subscribe thank you back to the tutorial let's go to Geometry notes because let's go to Geometry notes because let's go to Geometry notes because that's what we're going to do most of that's what we're going to do most of that's what we're going to do most of the work uh over here I would like to the work uh over here I would like to the work uh over here I would like to create a new collection let's call it create a new collection let's call it create a new collection let's call it audio and take the ancosphere cube and audio and take the ancosphere cube and audio and take the ancosphere cube and the Taurus and just drag it into the the Taurus and just drag it into the the Taurus and just drag it into the audio collection first thing we want to audio collection first thing we want to audio collection first thing we want to do is let's maybe take care of the base do is let's maybe take care of the base do is let's maybe take care of the base okay so for the base animation I had okay so for the base animation I had okay so for the base animation I had those bubbles in the center of the those bubbles in the center of the those bubbles in the center of the screen screen screen maybe let's just align our camera also maybe let's just align our camera also maybe let's just align our camera also again we don't have screencast keys are again we don't have screencast keys are again we don't have screencast keys are showing up an rx90 and gy bring it out showing up an rx90 and gy bring it out showing up an rx90 and gy bring it out look through the camera this is what look through the camera this is what look through the camera this is what we're looking at now we're going to need we're looking at now we're going to need we're looking at now we're going to need an object for our base uh Motion an object for our base uh Motion an object for our base uh Motion Graphics so let's bring an object in it Graphics so let's bring an object in it Graphics so let's bring an object in it doesn't matter what or actually does it doesn't matter what or actually does it doesn't matter what or actually does it matter matter matter probably not we just let's just take an probably not we just let's just take an probably not we just let's just take an ecosphere ecosphere ecosphere okay okay okay Bring It Forward maybe a little bit Bring It Forward maybe a little bit Bring It Forward maybe a little bit and on this object here let's call that and on this object here let's call that and on this object here let's call that a base a base a base on the base object we create a new on the base object we create a new on the base object we create a new geometry nodes node tree and in here geometry nodes node tree and in here geometry nodes node tree and in here we're gonna now take in the information we're gonna now take in the information we're gonna now take in the information of our Cube pin this view so now we can of our Cube pin this view so now we can of our Cube pin this view so now we can drag in the cube because that's our base drag in the cube because that's our base drag in the cube because that's our base audio information and it's stored in the audio information and it's stored in the audio information and it's stored in the location here location here location here but it's only in the C component of the but it's only in the C component of the but it's only in the C component of the location so we have to separate location so we have to separate location so we have to separate x y z and this is now the volume of the x y z and this is now the volume of the x y z and this is now the volume of the base part of our audio file cool so what base part of our audio file cool so what base part of our audio file cool so what do we want to do we want to probably go do we want to do we want to probably go do we want to do we want to probably go into let's look through the camera once into let's look through the camera once into let's look through the camera once more more more let's maybe scale this up let's maybe scale this up let's maybe scale this up also I should have subdivided this a lot also I should have subdivided this a lot also I should have subdivided this a lot more probably more probably more probably so let's make it a little bit rounder so let's make it a little bit rounder so let's make it a little bit rounder okay now we're going to distribute some okay now we're going to distribute some okay now we're going to distribute some points onto this so we wanted this points onto this so we wanted this points onto this so we wanted this tribute points on faces and the density tribute points on faces and the density tribute points on faces and the density is actually what we're going to plug in is actually what we're going to plug in is actually what we're going to plug in from our audio information so so when from our audio information so so when from our audio information so so when there's a lot of bass happening then we there's a lot of bass happening then we there's a lot of bass happening then we have more points distributed onto our have more points distributed onto our have more points distributed onto our ecosphere ecosphere ecosphere let's see if it works so let's go here let's see if it works so let's go here let's see if it works so let's go here we have the music playing okay we can see okay we can see okay we can see more Bass more Bass more Bass and we get more points distributed all and we get more points distributed all and we get more points distributed all right seems to be pretty cool but we right seems to be pretty cool but we right seems to be pretty cool but we want to maybe take away the really quiet want to maybe take away the really quiet want to maybe take away the really quiet parts parts parts now I didn't find a smooth solution for now I didn't find a smooth solution for now I didn't find a smooth solution for sort of a high pass filter sort of a high pass filter sort of a high pass filter but we can always just do but we can always just do but we can always just do maybe a compare maybe a compare maybe a compare compare and say okay if our volume compare and say okay if our volume compare and say okay if our volume information information information is less than I don't know 0.3 then we is less than I don't know 0.3 then we is less than I don't know 0.3 then we want to switch want to switch want to switch a float value float um um um okay so if it's less than we want zero okay so if it's less than we want zero okay so if it's less than we want zero if it's greater than we want this if it's greater than we want this if it's greater than we want this okay and then also we should add okay and then also we should add okay and then also we should add probably a math node so we can multiply probably a math node so we can multiply probably a math node so we can multiply our value our value our value a little bit a little bit a little bit bring this over and this is our density bring this over and this is our density bring this over and this is our density in a team in a team in a team okay so when there's when there's almost okay so when there's when there's almost okay so when there's when there's almost no bass happening we have zero point and no bass happening we have zero point and no bass happening we have zero point and only if our value is above 0.3 we get only if our value is above 0.3 we get only if our value is above 0.3 we get some points we can increase this to a some points we can increase this to a some points we can increase this to a 0.5 0.5 0.5 all right all right that's the base all right all right that's the base all right all right that's the base information now this is just a point information now this is just a point information now this is just a point Cloud there's nothing to render and we Cloud there's nothing to render and we Cloud there's nothing to render and we can't actually see anything if we would can't actually see anything if we would can't actually see anything if we would hit render now so right away we can do hit render now so right away we can do hit render now so right away we can do in in instance on points in in instance on points in in instance on points and what do we want to instance and what do we want to instance and what do we want to instance maybe an icosphere maybe an icosphere maybe an icosphere with a few subdivisions with a few subdivisions with a few subdivisions all right cool all right cool all right cool have this now okay now for the actual animation we okay now for the actual animation we okay now for the actual animation we want these icospheres yeah the want these icospheres yeah the want these icospheres yeah the ecospheres to ecospheres to ecospheres to um like appear when the bass hits and um like appear when the bass hits and um like appear when the bass hits and then just shrink down to nothing then just shrink down to nothing then just shrink down to nothing okay okay okay let's do that and we have to do that in let's do that and we have to do that in let's do that and we have to do that in a simulation a simulation a simulation Zone just a quick reminder if you have Zone just a quick reminder if you have Zone just a quick reminder if you have no idea how this works I have an entire no idea how this works I have an entire no idea how this works I have an entire tutorial series looking at the tutorial series looking at the tutorial series looking at the simulation and zones and the simulation simulation and zones and the simulation simulation and zones and the simulation nodes in blender geometry nodes nodes in blender geometry nodes nodes in blender geometry nodes so you should watch those videos first so you should watch those videos first so you should watch those videos first probably probably probably all right now let's plug this in we want all right now let's plug this in we want all right now let's plug this in we want to simulate our geometry the geometry in to simulate our geometry the geometry in to simulate our geometry the geometry in this case is like I said just a point this case is like I said just a point this case is like I said just a point cloud cloud cloud okay now we want okay now we want okay now we want um um um the Spheres to shrink down the Spheres to shrink down the Spheres to shrink down for that we need to simulate something for that we need to simulate something for that we need to simulate something in this Zone over time in this Zone over time in this Zone over time let's give each sphere the information let's give each sphere the information let's give each sphere the information of its size we can do that of its size we can do that of its size we can do that but just or we could capture an but just or we could capture an but just or we could capture an attribute or we could use a named attribute or we could use a named attribute or we could use a named attribute but each point in a point attribute but each point in a point attribute but each point in a point cloud has more than just a position it cloud has more than just a position it cloud has more than just a position it also knows it also has a rotation and it also knows it also has a rotation and it also knows it also has a rotation and it also has a scale which in case of a also has a scale which in case of a also has a scale which in case of a point is the radius point is the radius point is the radius so we can go search radius and we can so we can go search radius and we can so we can go search radius and we can say set point radius and let's just say set point radius and let's just say set point radius and let's just start off with a radius of one so we start off with a radius of one so we start off with a radius of one so we have sort of a factor between one and have sort of a factor between one and have sort of a factor between one and zero zero zero okay we have a radius of one and then okay we have a radius of one and then okay we have a radius of one and then over time which is in here the over time which is in here the over time which is in here the simulation so whatever you plug in here simulation so whatever you plug in here simulation so whatever you plug in here is just for the first frame is just for the first frame is just for the first frame after the first frame you're just after the first frame you're just after the first frame you're just simulating stuff here and none of this simulating stuff here and none of this simulating stuff here and none of this input is uh used anymore okay so in our input is uh used anymore okay so in our input is uh used anymore okay so in our inside of the simulation we want to get inside of the simulation we want to get inside of the simulation we want to get the point radius and then set the point the point radius and then set the point the point radius and then set the point radius to a new radius to a new radius to a new a value let's do reduce okay we should a value let's do reduce okay we should a value let's do reduce okay we should we read the radius and we need a math we read the radius and we need a math we read the radius and we need a math node node node and we can multiply and we can multiply and we can multiply the previous radius by I don't know 0.7 the previous radius by I don't know 0.7 the previous radius by I don't know 0.7 and then we set the point radius now of and then we set the point radius now of and then we set the point radius now of course this is already working but it's course this is already working but it's course this is already working but it's not showing up because we're not using not showing up because we're not using not showing up because we're not using it yet because when we actually instant it yet because when we actually instant it yet because when we actually instant some icospheres onto our points out here some icospheres onto our points out here some icospheres onto our points out here we can give it a scale and again use the we can give it a scale and again use the we can give it a scale and again use the radius okay now this is actually not radius okay now this is actually not radius okay now this is actually not correct yet because on each frame we correct yet because on each frame we correct yet because on each frame we create some point onto our big icosphere create some point onto our big icosphere create some point onto our big icosphere and then we want to animate those but and then we want to animate those but and then we want to animate those but of course on the next frame of course on the next frame of course on the next frame they're they're disappeared again they're they're disappeared again they're they're disappeared again because we create new points onto our because we create new points onto our because we create new points onto our geometry geometry geometry so we don't actually want to plug this so we don't actually want to plug this so we don't actually want to plug this into our simulation like this into our simulation like this into our simulation like this we want two we want two we want two add the points the new points to the add the points the new points to the add the points the new points to the existing simulation so remember on all existing simulation so remember on all existing simulation so remember on all of these frames this is just running in of these frames this is just running in of these frames this is just running in a circle here this is just keeps a circle here this is just keeps a circle here this is just keeps simulating on each frame and we want to simulating on each frame and we want to simulating on each frame and we want to have the points from the previous frame have the points from the previous frame have the points from the previous frame and add these points to it and add these points to it and add these points to it so we need to join geometry so we need to join geometry so we need to join geometry the one from the previous frame and we the one from the previous frame and we the one from the previous frame and we add the new points to that add the new points to that add the new points to that and then of course actually we want to and then of course actually we want to and then of course actually we want to set our set our set our we want to set the point radius only on we want to set the point radius only on we want to set the point radius only on the old geometry so the new geometry has the old geometry so the new geometry has the old geometry so the new geometry has a radius of one the old geometry coming a radius of one the old geometry coming a radius of one the old geometry coming in from the previous frame has a radius in from the previous frame has a radius in from the previous frame has a radius and we change it and set the new radius and we change it and set the new radius and we change it and set the new radius and then we have join and then we have join and then we have join and now let's see if that works okay okay okay yes seems to be working okay so we're yes seems to be working okay so we're yes seems to be working okay so we're Distributing points now of course this Distributing points now of course this Distributing points now of course this is all a bit big so we can either play is all a bit big so we can either play is all a bit big so we can either play with the radius with the radius with the radius or we could let's bring this down a or we could let's bring this down a or we could let's bring this down a little so we have cleaner noodles little so we have cleaner noodles little so we have cleaner noodles or we could just say okay let's start or we could just say okay let's start or we could just say okay let's start with the radius of 0.5 Maybe yep that's exactly what we want however yep that's exactly what we want however yep that's exactly what we want however there's one thing now that we can't even there's one thing now that we can't even there's one thing now that we can't even see but it is happening and that is let see but it is happening and that is let see but it is happening and that is let me just go back a few frames okay so the me just go back a few frames okay so the me just go back a few frames okay so the bass drum hits we get new points they're bass drum hits we get new points they're bass drum hits we get new points they're big then with our simulation we decrease big then with our simulation we decrease big then with our simulation we decrease the size by multiplying the previous the size by multiplying the previous the size by multiplying the previous radius with 0.7 and then radius with 0.7 and then radius with 0.7 and then they just basically disappear because they just basically disappear because they just basically disappear because they get so small however they're still they get so small however they're still they get so small however they're still there there there so this geometry here is keeps growing so this geometry here is keeps growing so this geometry here is keeps growing and keeps growing we just add points and and keeps growing we just add points and and keeps growing we just add points and add points on each frame add points on each frame add points on each frame we don't need to do this we could just we don't need to do this we could just we don't need to do this we could just delete some of the points once they are delete some of the points once they are delete some of the points once they are not visible anymore anyway right you not visible anymore anyway right you not visible anymore anyway right you don't want to just load up your geometry don't want to just load up your geometry don't want to just load up your geometry node simulation with millions of points node simulation with millions of points node simulation with millions of points so how do we do that well we can just go so how do we do that well we can just go so how do we do that well we can just go uh geometry delete geometry and what uh geometry delete geometry and what uh geometry delete geometry and what geometry what points are we going to geometry what points are we going to geometry what points are we going to delete delete delete uh the ones where we need a math uh the ones where we need a math uh the ones where we need a math node node node can I just look for less than oh math can I just look for less than oh math can I just look for less than oh math less than cool where the radius of the less than cool where the radius of the less than cool where the radius of the point point point is less than let's just say point I is less than let's just say point I is less than let's just say point I don't know zero one see how that works don't know zero one see how that works don't know zero one see how that works okay okay and then down here we can see we okay and then down here we can see we okay and then down here we can see we have 595 instances currently have 595 instances currently have 595 instances currently we let it run some more now we have 727 okay let's go forward a few frames you okay let's go forward a few frames you okay let's go forward a few frames you can see can see can see now we have 400 now we have 400 now we have 400 okay now we have more again and then okay now we have more again and then okay now we have more again and then because when the the base drum hits then because when the the base drum hits then because when the the base drum hits then we get a lot of points we get a lot of points we get a lot of points um so maybe this value is a bit much um so maybe this value is a bit much um so maybe this value is a bit much let's just multiply it by two and see yep okay yep okay yep okay pretty cool and we're not just adding pretty cool and we're not just adding pretty cool and we're not just adding new points new points new points um we're also getting rid of the points um we're also getting rid of the points um we're also getting rid of the points that we can't see anymore anyway and that we can't see anymore anyway and that we can't see anymore anyway and this is all we need to make sound this is all we need to make sound this is all we need to make sound reactive Motion Graphics okay now let me reactive Motion Graphics okay now let me reactive Motion Graphics okay now let me open the demo file and show you all the open the demo file and show you all the open the demo file and show you all the other parts other parts other parts okay this is my demo file and you can okay this is my demo file and you can okay this is my demo file and you can see here I am on the low frequency see here I am on the low frequency see here I am on the low frequency object here and this is exactly the same object here and this is exactly the same object here and this is exactly the same node tree we take the information from node tree we take the information from node tree we take the information from the cube I called it the cube I called it the cube I called it low but it's the cube low but it's the cube low but it's the cube okay so we take the low information the okay so we take the low information the okay so we take the low information the C axis we do our high pass filter here C axis we do our high pass filter here C axis we do our high pass filter here distribute the points set the radius distribute the points set the radius distribute the points set the radius um um um make them smaller over time or decrease make them smaller over time or decrease make them smaller over time or decrease the radius over time we delete the the radius over time we delete the the radius over time we delete the geometry we can't see anymore we geometry we can't see anymore we geometry we can't see anymore we instance icospheres and then back here I instance icospheres and then back here I instance icospheres and then back here I also set smooth also set smooth also set smooth which you have to do inside of geometry which you have to do inside of geometry which you have to do inside of geometry nodes so that these spheres are smooth nodes so that these spheres are smooth nodes so that these spheres are smooth and then I also have a material and then I also have a material and then I also have a material the material is this one the material is this one the material is this one where I just assign a random where I just assign a random where I just assign a random Factor here to get a little bit of Factor here to get a little bit of Factor here to get a little bit of variation so we have some yellow and variation so we have some yellow and variation so we have some yellow and some red some red some red with this color amp and then I use the with this color amp and then I use the with this color amp and then I use the layer weight layer weight layer weight and I'm sure you've seen this before and I'm sure you've seen this before and I'm sure you've seen this before this is the layer of weight this is the layer of weight this is the layer of weight and usually it looks like this so that and usually it looks like this so that and usually it looks like this so that gives you the angle of the surface to gives you the angle of the surface to gives you the angle of the surface to your camera your camera your camera and you can turn down the blend so you and you can turn down the blend so you and you can turn down the blend so you can just get the outer the circle can just get the outer the circle can just get the outer the circle basically of the sphere and you plug basically of the sphere and you plug basically of the sphere and you plug that through a color ramp that through a color ramp that through a color ramp you can do something like this you can do something like this you can do something like this the cool looking and then I just use the the cool looking and then I just use the the cool looking and then I just use the emission Shader emission Shader emission Shader and I don't even know if I need this and I don't even know if I need this and I don't even know if I need this hold on do I need this hold on do I need this hold on do I need this oh yeah okay I use this Factor here that oh yeah okay I use this Factor here that oh yeah okay I use this Factor here that gives me just a circle to mix between gives me just a circle to mix between gives me just a circle to mix between the emission Shader and an empty Shader the emission Shader and an empty Shader the emission Shader and an empty Shader which gives me the black inside and this which gives me the black inside and this which gives me the black inside and this also gives a cool effect because it also gives a cool effect because it also gives a cool effect because it looks sort of like a cartoonish Cloud looks sort of like a cartoonish Cloud looks sort of like a cartoonish Cloud because we don't get the full circles because we don't get the full circles because we don't get the full circles where we have overlapping spheres so I where we have overlapping spheres so I where we have overlapping spheres so I think this is actually a pretty cool think this is actually a pretty cool think this is actually a pretty cool Shader Shader Shader to create these to create these to create these sort of cartoony clouds okay now go back sort of cartoony clouds okay now go back sort of cartoony clouds okay now go back to Geometry nodes let's look at the mid to Geometry nodes let's look at the mid to Geometry nodes let's look at the mid what have we done for the mid so we're what have we done for the mid so we're what have we done for the mid so we're taking the the C location from our mid taking the the C location from our mid taking the the C location from our mid object which was uh the sphere object which was uh the sphere object which was uh the sphere and then again we separate high pass and then again we separate high pass and then again we separate high pass filter multiply filter multiply filter multiply and what I've done here is my mid object and what I've done here is my mid object and what I've done here is my mid object this guy here this guy here this guy here is actually an ecosphere a very tiny is actually an ecosphere a very tiny is actually an ecosphere a very tiny icosphere in the middle of the scene icosphere in the middle of the scene icosphere in the middle of the scene and I can emit particles like all of and I can emit particles like all of and I can emit particles like all of these thoughts here these thoughts here these thoughts here by shooting them out along the normal so by shooting them out along the normal so by shooting them out along the normal so if you have the ecosphere you want the if you have the ecosphere you want the if you have the ecosphere you want the normal it would be here and this normal normal it would be here and this normal normal it would be here and this normal will be here right so we can emit will be here right so we can emit will be here right so we can emit particles like this from our original particles like this from our original particles like this from our original geometry which is an icosphere by taking geometry which is an icosphere by taking geometry which is an icosphere by taking the normal of our ecosphere the normal of our ecosphere the normal of our ecosphere and storing this in a named attribute and storing this in a named attribute and storing this in a named attribute and I called it V for velocity so each and I called it V for velocity so each and I called it V for velocity so each of our points of our points of our points that we're emitting on each frame now that we're emitting on each frame now that we're emitting on each frame now has the velocity I also store another has the velocity I also store another has the velocity I also store another attribute called age inside of the attribute called age inside of the attribute called age inside of the simulation I take the H I add one so on simulation I take the H I add one so on simulation I take the H I add one so on each frame each particle each frame each particle each frame each particle gets older by one right so read add gets older by one right so read add gets older by one right so read add store store store again we have delete geometry here again we have delete geometry here again we have delete geometry here because we want to delete the particles because we want to delete the particles because we want to delete the particles once they leave once they leave once they leave um our frame so this is the camera frame um our frame so this is the camera frame um our frame so this is the camera frame here I don't know if you can see this on here I don't know if you can see this on here I don't know if you can see this on the recording but we don't need to make the recording but we don't need to make the recording but we don't need to make them fly out infinitely once they hit them fly out infinitely once they hit them fly out infinitely once they hit outside here or once they reach the outside here or once they reach the outside here or once they reach the outside of our frame we can delete them outside of our frame we can delete them outside of our frame we can delete them so that's where what we're doing here if so that's where what we're doing here if so that's where what we're doing here if our age is greater than 60 we delete the our age is greater than 60 we delete the our age is greater than 60 we delete the point point point and then of course we want to move the and then of course we want to move the and then of course we want to move the point on each frame we move each point point on each frame we move each point point on each frame we move each point on the V remember V is our velocity on the V remember V is our velocity on the V remember V is our velocity which is the normal which is the normal which is the normal so we have a lot of particles flying so we have a lot of particles flying so we have a lot of particles flying outwards and also outwards and also outwards and also V let me see here I'm scaling the normal V let me see here I'm scaling the normal V let me see here I'm scaling the normal based on based on based on you can probably see this here you can probably see this here you can probably see this here based on the C of our music based on the C of our music based on the C of our music right so particles the V Vector velocity right so particles the V Vector velocity right so particles the V Vector velocity Vector is greater longer where the music Vector is greater longer where the music Vector is greater longer where the music is louder and remember we're just is louder and remember we're just is louder and remember we're just talking about the mid-range frequencies talking about the mid-range frequencies talking about the mid-range frequencies here here here so the louder mid-range hits that we so the louder mid-range hits that we so the louder mid-range hits that we have the longer our velocity is which have the longer our velocity is which have the longer our velocity is which means the faster these particles are means the faster these particles are means the faster these particles are flying and then back here it's same flying and then back here it's same flying and then back here it's same thing we're creating ecospheres which thing we're creating ecospheres which thing we're creating ecospheres which are all of these little dots we have set are all of these little dots we have set are all of these little dots we have set smooth have a different material smooth have a different material smooth have a different material let's look at the material real quick let's look at the material real quick let's look at the material real quick the material uses the age the material uses the age the material uses the age to have a color ramp between h0 and H1 to have a color ramp between h0 and H1 to have a color ramp between h0 and H1 so in order to get a factor between 0 so in order to get a factor between 0 so in order to get a factor between 0 and 1 we have to divide the H by 60. and 1 we have to divide the H by 60. and 1 we have to divide the H by 60. remember we're deleting the particles remember we're deleting the particles remember we're deleting the particles after 60 frames so no particle is ever after 60 frames so no particle is ever after 60 frames so no particle is ever older than 60. older than 60. older than 60. so we had a factor between zero and one so we had a factor between zero and one so we had a factor between zero and one so when they're born they're bright so when they're born they're bright so when they're born they're bright white and then over time we have this white and then over time we have this white and then over time we have this color ramp emission Shader and that's it color ramp emission Shader and that's it color ramp emission Shader and that's it so if we hit play so if we hit play so if we hit play this is what we get this is what we get this is what we get you can see we have some particles you can see we have some particles you can see we have some particles flying faster and some are slower and flying faster and some are slower and flying faster and some are slower and that's just the volume of our mid-range that's just the volume of our mid-range that's just the volume of our mid-range audio audio audio all right all right all right so that's that and then we have the high so that's that and then we have the high so that's that and then we have the high frequencies let's look at those geometry frequencies let's look at those geometry frequencies let's look at those geometry nodes nodes nodes high frequency high and in here you can high frequency high and in here you can high frequency high and in here you can see I don't even have a simulation area see I don't even have a simulation area see I don't even have a simulation area on each frame I simply create two random on each frame I simply create two random on each frame I simply create two random vectors vectors vectors that are just somewhere inside of my that are just somewhere inside of my that are just somewhere inside of my frame so x minus 50 c minus 20 and frame so x minus 50 c minus 20 and frame so x minus 50 c minus 20 and they're all on the they're all on the they're all on the on the Y 0 plane on the Y 0 plane on the Y 0 plane so we just get some random vectors if we so we just get some random vectors if we so we just get some random vectors if we look at it from the front look at it from the front look at it from the front and then we have two random vectors and and then we have two random vectors and and then we have two random vectors and they also have different values because they also have different values because they also have different values because I plug the frame from our animation I plug the frame from our animation I plug the frame from our animation value into the ID here value into the ID here value into the ID here so we had two different random vectors so we had two different random vectors so we had two different random vectors create a curve out of that curve to mesh create a curve out of that curve to mesh create a curve out of that curve to mesh based on a circle based on a circle based on a circle and then set the material to the high and then set the material to the high and then set the material to the high material the high material is just an material the high material is just an material the high material is just an emission Shader with a very high emission Shader with a very high emission Shader with a very high strength which gives us this sort of strength which gives us this sort of strength which gives us this sort of laser beam look laser beam look laser beam look and and and down here down here down here I'm using the audio information again I'm using the audio information again I'm using the audio information again the C value the C value the C value from The High Frequency info and if and from The High Frequency info and if and from The High Frequency info and if and I say if that is greater than this is I say if that is greater than this is I say if that is greater than this is again sort of a high pass again sort of a high pass again sort of a high pass then either we have 0 or that value then either we have 0 or that value then either we have 0 or that value which is the high pass and I use that as which is the high pass and I use that as which is the high pass and I use that as the curve Circle for this line so the curve Circle for this line so the curve Circle for this line so essentially we get a random line on our essentially we get a random line on our essentially we get a random line on our screen on every single frame screen on every single frame screen on every single frame but on the frames where the high but on the frames where the high but on the frames where the high frequency audio is not very loud frequency audio is not very loud frequency audio is not very loud the radius is zero so we just can't see the radius is zero so we just can't see the radius is zero so we just can't see it it it all right so this doesn't even have an all right so this doesn't even have an all right so this doesn't even have an animation this is just like laser light animation this is just like laser light animation this is just like laser light flickering and if we put it all together flickering and if we put it all together flickering and if we put it all together and hit spacebar and hit spacebar and hit spacebar then this is what we get then this is what we get then this is what we get now remember we got the audio now remember we got the audio now remember we got the audio information into these three objects information into these three objects information into these three objects here by baking the audio and selecting a here by baking the audio and selecting a here by baking the audio and selecting a certain frequency range certain frequency range certain frequency range and if you wanted to create a spectrum and if you wanted to create a spectrum and if you wanted to create a spectrum analyzer you could do the same thing analyzer you could do the same thing analyzer you could do the same thing um just I don't know get 10 divisions of um just I don't know get 10 divisions of um just I don't know get 10 divisions of your frequency range and then have bars your frequency range and then have bars your frequency range and then have bars scaled on the C and have a Shader going scaled on the C and have a Shader going scaled on the C and have a Shader going from green to Yellow to Red it's really from green to Yellow to Red it's really from green to Yellow to Red it's really very easy that's it as always the very easy that's it as always the very
