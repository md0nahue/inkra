Kind: captions Language: en e hello everyone this is Brennan here from hello everyone this is Brennan here from hello everyone this is Brennan here from b.net and in this tutorial we're going b.net and in this tutorial we're going b.net and in this tutorial we're going to be making an advanced audio to be making an advanced audio to be making an advanced audio visualizer and um I'm really sorry for visualizer and um I'm really sorry for visualizer and um I'm really sorry for not having this tutorial out not having this tutorial out not having this tutorial out sooner um but anyway let's get to sooner um but anyway let's get to sooner um but anyway let's get to talking about this talking about this talking about this tutorial so this tutorial was requested tutorial so this tutorial was requested tutorial so this tutorial was requested by sanj Pandit he wanted me to make a by sanj Pandit he wanted me to make a by sanj Pandit he wanted me to make a tutorial on how to make basically a more tutorial on how to make basically a more tutorial on how to make basically a more advanced audio advanced audio advanced audio visualizer so as you can see here this visualizer so as you can see here this visualizer so as you can see here this is my example of a more advanced audio is my example of a more advanced audio is my example of a more advanced audio visualizer he also asked if I can make visualizer he also asked if I can make visualizer he also asked if I can make cubes bouncing on top of other cubes cubes bouncing on top of other cubes cubes bouncing on top of other cubes that are moving vertically and I added this cube in just as a side and I added this cube in just as a side and I added this cube in just as a side thing just to uh add extra an extra an extra an extra extra extra bar so as you can see both of the cubes he so as you can see both of the cubes he so as you can see both of the cubes he asked if I can make two different cubes asked if I can make two different cubes asked if I can make two different cubes or just cubes bouncing on top of other or just cubes bouncing on top of other or just cubes bouncing on top of other cubes just like this this is what I I cubes just like this this is what I I cubes just like this this is what I I imagine he meant and um I imagine he meant and um I imagine he meant and um I hope I hope this is what you meant or hope I hope this is what you meant or hope I hope this is what you meant or what he meant if you're watching this tutorial so we're going to make this let's start so we're going to make this let's start so we're going to make this let's start by creating all of these cubes let's go by creating all of these cubes let's go by creating all of these cubes let's go and jump into and jump into and jump into blender okay so here we are in blunder blender okay so here we are in blunder blender okay so here we are in blunder this is version this is version this is version 2.68 and I just went into front view 2.68 and I just went into front view 2.68 and I just went into front view right there or you can right there or you can right there or you can press numpad one on the keyboard and you press numpad one on the keyboard and you press numpad one on the keyboard and you press five to go in orthographic view so press five to go in orthographic view so press five to go in orthographic view so it says front Ortho so now we're in it says front Ortho so now we're in it says front Ortho so now we're in front view let's go ahead and duplicate front view let's go ahead and duplicate front view let's go ahead and duplicate this cube move it to the this cube move it to the this cube move it to the left and let's turn on snapping vertex left and let's turn on snapping vertex left and let's turn on snapping vertex snapping let's press snapping let's press snapping let's press GX hold down control hover your cursor GX hold down control hover your cursor GX hold down control hover your cursor over the corner or the verticy of this over the corner or the verticy of this over the corner or the verticy of this Cube which is right there and now it Cube which is right there and now it Cube which is right there and now it snaps it right up against this cube in snaps it right up against this cube in snaps it right up against this cube in the middle and let's go ahead and the middle and let's go ahead and the middle and let's go ahead and duplicate this Cube again move it all duplicate this Cube again move it all duplicate this Cube again move it all the way to the the way to the the way to the right GX on the keyboard hold down right GX on the keyboard hold down right GX on the keyboard hold down control and there it is right up against control and there it is right up against control and there it is right up against the cube now let's go ahead and change the cube now let's go ahead and change the cube now let's go ahead and change these colors of these cubes start with these colors of these cubes start with these colors of these cubes start with this one on the very this one on the very this one on the very left let's change this name to left let's change this name to left let's change this name to Yellow to to to yellow and let's make each one its own yellow and let's make each one its own yellow and let's make each one its own individual material and the way we do individual material and the way we do individual material and the way we do that is just by clicking this number that is just by clicking this number that is just by clicking this number right here it's number three there we go right here it's number three there we go right here it's number three there we go now it has its own name its own now it has its own name its own now it has its own name its own name name name green let's change it to green let's change it to green let's change it to green neon Type green neon Type green neon Type green uh let's change this to Blue this green uh let's change this to Blue this green uh let's change this to Blue this looks kind of like a must yellow make it looks kind of like a must yellow make it looks kind of like a must yellow make it a little bit lighter change this make a little bit lighter change this make a little bit lighter change this make this its own material and let's change this its own material and let's change this its own material and let's change this to Blue so this will be blue this this to Blue so this will be blue this this to Blue so this will be blue this will be green and this will be yellow will be green and this will be yellow will be green and this will be yellow and let's go ahead and name these cubes and let's go ahead and name these cubes and let's go ahead and name these cubes this will be this will be this will be yellow this will be yellow this will be yellow this will be green and this will be blue all right now let us add another blue all right now let us add another blue all right now let us add another Cube let's add two cubes duplicate Cube let's add two cubes duplicate Cube let's add two cubes duplicate this let's scale these cubes this let's scale these cubes this let's scale these cubes down about that down about that down about that small it's probably small it's probably small it's probably about let's just say duplicate this alt about let's just say duplicate this alt about let's just say duplicate this alt S and S S and S S and S S5 wait s S5 wait s S5 wait s .5 so maybe about s.2 maybe three blender units so s Nega s.2 maybe three blender units so s Nega s.2 maybe three blender units so s Nega S3 about three blender units down scale S3 about three blender units down scale S3 about three blender units down scale it about that that small should be it about that that small should be it about that that small should be good and let's go into front view no good and let's go into front view no good and let's go into front view no actually we don't need to Let's create a actually we don't need to Let's create a actually we don't need to Let's create a material for these two this will be material for these two this will be material for these two this will be orange orange orange orange this will be gray gray gray gray gray spelled spelled spelled right orange and right orange and right orange and gray let's change this to Orange it's gray let's change this to Orange it's gray let's change this to Orange it's good orange color it's actually darker good orange color it's actually darker good orange color it's actually darker than the one in the tutorial I think but than the one in the tutorial I think but than the one in the tutorial I think but that's all that's all that's all right uh let's change this to right uh let's change this to right uh let's change this to gray all right now let's set the origin gray all right now let's set the origin gray all right now let's set the origin points to all of these cubes right here points to all of these cubes right here points to all of these cubes right here and we won't really need to mess with and we won't really need to mess with and we won't really need to mess with the Origins on these so let's begin by the Origins on these so let's begin by the Origins on these so let's begin by selecting this selecting this selecting this Cube selecting the top of this Cube Cube selecting the top of this Cube Cube selecting the top of this Cube select cursor to selected and control select cursor to selected and control select cursor to selected and control shift alt C on the keyboard it's a lot shift alt C on the keyboard it's a lot shift alt C on the keyboard it's a lot of buttons but control shift alt C of buttons but control shift alt C of buttons but control shift alt C origin to 3D cursor that's what we want origin to 3D cursor that's what we want origin to 3D cursor that's what we want to select it'll set the origin to the to select it'll set the origin to the to select it'll set the origin to the top of this Cube now let's move this top of this Cube now let's move this top of this Cube now let's move this Cube all the way down Cube all the way down Cube all the way down let's press gz on the keyboard hold down let's press gz on the keyboard hold down let's press gz on the keyboard hold down control to snap to this control to snap to this control to snap to this vertex and now it's just like in the vertex and now it's just like in the vertex and now it's just like in the tutorial animation or the video intro tutorial animation or the video intro tutorial animation or the video intro that I made uh preview actually this will now scale downwards actually this will now scale downwards actually this will now scale downwards this we want to scale upwards so we'll this we want to scale upwards so we'll this we want to scale upwards so we'll set the origin point to the bottom of set the origin point to the bottom of set the origin point to the bottom of the the the cube uh select the bottom actually have cube uh select the bottom actually have cube uh select the bottom actually have face select mode selected so Rotex Edge face select mode selected so Rotex Edge face select mode selected so Rotex Edge and I have face selected so let's uh do and I have face selected so let's uh do and I have face selected so let's uh do shift s cursor 2 selected again go back shift s cursor 2 selected again go back shift s cursor 2 selected again go back into object mode control shift alt C into object mode control shift alt C into object mode control shift alt C origin to 3D cursor so I set the origin origin to 3D cursor so I set the origin origin to 3D cursor so I set the origin to 3D to 3D to 3D cursor now we would like this origin to cursor now we would like this origin to cursor now we would like this origin to come we' like this Cube to come we' like this Cube to come we' like this Cube to scale uh scale uh scale uh horizontally so let's go into edit mode horizontally so let's go into edit mode horizontally so let's go into edit mode select this to see through this Cube select this to see through this Cube select this to see through this Cube select the face that we select the face that we select the face that we want shift s cursor to selected control want shift s cursor to selected control want shift s cursor to selected control shift alt C origin to 3D cursor now I shift alt C origin to 3D cursor now I shift alt C origin to 3D cursor now I will scale horizontally to the will scale horizontally to the will scale horizontally to the right and that's perfect that's just right and that's perfect that's just right and that's perfect that's just what we want so now we have all of them what we want so now we have all of them what we want so now we have all of them scaling the right scaling the right scaling the right directions and let's begin by moving directions and let's begin by moving directions and let's begin by moving this Cube this Cube this Cube down and down and down and actually snapping It To The Top actually snapping It To The Top actually snapping It To The Top or actually now it would be the bottom or actually now it would be the bottom or actually now it would be the bottom of this Cube basically because the top of this Cube basically because the top of this Cube basically because the top is going up and the bottom is staying is going up and the bottom is staying is going up and the bottom is staying down but it's upside down it's almost down but it's upside down it's almost down but it's upside down it's almost like it like it like it is otherwise it would be like this one is otherwise it would be like this one is otherwise it would be like this one the top is going up and bottom staying the top is going up and bottom staying the top is going up and bottom staying where it's supposed to be so let's where it's supposed to be so let's where it's supposed to be so let's select this select this select this Cube and in the tutorial in the original Cube and in the tutorial in the original Cube and in the tutorial in the original file file file I set this to I added added a floor I set this to I added added a floor I set this to I added added a floor constraint so I'm going to add the floor constraint so I'm going to add the floor constraint so I'm going to add the floor constraint and this is called yellow so constraint and this is called yellow so constraint and this is called yellow so we would like to we would like the we would like to we would like the we would like to we would like the target to be yellow because the floor target to be yellow because the floor target to be yellow because the floor will be the yellow Cube so there we go will be the yellow Cube so there we go will be the yellow Cube so there we go it stays on the floor like it's supposed it stays on the floor like it's supposed it stays on the floor like it's supposed to only thing is that it doesn't stay on to only thing is that it doesn't stay on to only thing is that it doesn't stay on well actually it does but we want it to well actually it does but we want it to well actually it does but we want it to stay in the same position so we'll stay in the same position so we'll stay in the same position so we'll select sticky and use rotation so now it select sticky and use rotation so now it select sticky and use rotation so now it won't go anywhere after it touches it won't go anywhere after it touches it won't go anywhere after it touches it stay in the same position actually don't stay in the same position actually don't stay in the same position actually don't need this because it's not a rigid body need this because it's not a rigid body need this because it's not a rigid body as this will be a rigid as this will be a rigid as this will be a rigid body so now this will be going up and body so now this will be going up and body so now this will be going up and down and scaling at the same time so let's set this let's go to time so let's set this let's go to time so let's set this let's go to animation let's click on animation let's click on animation let's click on I location Z location it will be moving on location Z location it will be moving on location Z location it will be moving on the Z location z- axis on location and the Z location z- axis on location and the Z location z- axis on location and let's go ahead and select our music bake sound F bake sound F bake sound F curves and always make sure you're at curves and always make sure you're at curves and always make sure you're at the very first frame of the animation the very first frame of the animation the very first frame of the animation otherwise if you're over here it won't otherwise if you're over here it won't otherwise if you're over here it won't start till 100 frame start till 100 frame start till 100 frame 170 and mine was at zero so it will 170 and mine was at zero so it will 170 and mine was at zero so it will start from the beginning start to start from the beginning start to start from the beginning start to animate whoops start to animate from the animate whoops start to animate from the animate whoops start to animate from the very very very beginning so as you can see it's beginning so as you can see it's beginning so as you can see it's starting to animate starting to Jump by starting to animate starting to Jump by starting to animate starting to Jump by itself and it actually should be itself and it actually should be itself and it actually should be parented to this Cube so let's go ahead parented to this Cube so let's go ahead parented to this Cube so let's go ahead and do that select this Cube and select and do that select this Cube and select and do that select this Cube and select the yellow the yellow the yellow Cube contrl p on the keyboard select Cube contrl p on the keyboard select Cube contrl p on the keyboard select object so now it'll parent itself to object so now it'll parent itself to object so now it'll parent itself to this object so the parent is now the this object so the parent is now the this object so the parent is now the yellow cube move this down actually move yellow cube move this down actually move yellow cube move this down actually move back because I set the key frame to back because I set the key frame to back because I set the key frame to that probably just set this to that that probably just set this to that that probably just set this to that location it doesn't work so we will have location it doesn't work so we will have location it doesn't work so we will have have to go into edit have to go into edit have to go into edit mode and move it mode and move it mode and move it up move this up move this up move this Cube against that one and move it down to right there set one and move it down to right there set one and move it down to right there set the the the cursor and it moves back so we might cursor and it moves back so we might cursor and it moves back so we might have to move this by have to move this by have to move this by itself and then itself and then itself and then set the origin somewhere like there there there and now we will set the scaling of this and now we will set the scaling of this and now we will set the scaling of this one this object let's go ahead and one this object let's go ahead and one this object let's go ahead and select key or actually first we have to select key or actually first we have to select key or actually first we have to set set set scaling scaling scaling select the Z scale we wanted to scale on select the Z scale we wanted to scale on select the Z scale we wanted to scale on the z-axis downwards so we click on key the z-axis downwards so we click on key the z-axis downwards so we click on key bake sound to F curves bake our music bake sound to F curves bake our music bake sound to F curves bake our music bake it to the sound or music and now it bake it to the sound or music and now it bake it to the sound or music and now it will animate with a cube bouncing on top will animate with a cube bouncing on top will animate with a cube bouncing on top of it sometimes there are problems this of it sometimes there are problems this of it sometimes there are problems this is obviously having a is obviously having a is obviously having a problem problem problem and I can just do is scale this up but that's the basic idea just to get up but that's the basic idea just to get up but that's the basic idea just to get this Cube jumping on top of the other so there we go it jumps on top of other so there we go it jumps on top of other so there we go it jumps on top of the other the other the other Cube that's just what we want it's want it's want it's pretty there we go starting to jump pretty there we go starting to jump pretty there we go starting to jump that's perfect so the origin should be that's perfect so the origin should be that's perfect so the origin should be set somewhere up set somewhere up set somewhere up high because it's parented and high because it's parented and high because it's parented and everything has to do with that everything has to do with that everything has to do with that so excuse me let's select this orange so excuse me let's select this orange so excuse me let's select this orange Cube and let's go to the rigid the Cube and let's go to the rigid the Cube and let's go to the rigid the uh physics uh physics uh physics tab let's select rigid tab let's select rigid tab let's select rigid body this will be a rigid body active it body this will be a rigid body active it body this will be a rigid body active it be the type will be active and we'll be the type will be active and we'll be the type will be active and we'll select Dynamic mass will stay at one select Dynamic mass will stay at one select Dynamic mass will stay at one let's change this to a let's change this to a let's change this to a capsule change the rotation to capsule change the rotation to capsule change the rotation to zero transl ation will stay at zero transl ation will stay at zero transl ation will stay at 0.040 0.04 0.04 0.04 and that's it for and that's it for and that's it for this if you press alt a on your keyboard this if you press alt a on your keyboard this if you press alt a on your keyboard it should animate it should drop to the it should animate it should drop to the it should animate it should drop to the ground if not something is wrong there we go you have to start from wrong there we go you have to start from wrong there we go you have to start from the very beginning and to set the length the very beginning and to set the length the very beginning and to set the length of this animation you want to go to the of this animation you want to go to the of this animation you want to go to the uh uh uh scene scene scene Tab and set the rigid body cache to Tab and set the rigid body cache to Tab and set the rigid body cache to longer so if you want to do 400 frames longer so if you want to do 400 frames longer so if you want to do 400 frames let's set this to let's set this to let's set this to 400 and we will bake this free all bakes 400 and we will bake this free all bakes 400 and we will bake this free all bakes click on bake all Dynamics now it's click on bake all Dynamics now it's click on bake all Dynamics now it's baked the whole animation and it falls baked the whole animation and it falls baked the whole animation and it falls to the ground through this Cube that's to the ground through this Cube that's to the ground through this Cube that's not what we want we want this not what we want we want this not what we want we want this to bounce on top of this there's like a to bounce on top of this there's like a to bounce on top of this there's like a normal Cube normal Cube normal Cube should so or at least in this case we should so or at least in this case we should so or at least in this case we want it to bounce this Cube kind of want it to bounce this Cube kind of want it to bounce this Cube kind of jumps and size and jumps and size and jumps and size and scales which and this one will just be scales which and this one will just be scales which and this one will just be we just want it to bounce or jump kind we just want it to bounce or jump kind we just want it to bounce or jump kind of high it goes up to about there of high it goes up to about there of high it goes up to about there somewhere so let's go ahead and add a somewhere so let's go ahead and add a somewhere so let's go ahead and add a limit location and a limit limit location and a limit limit location and a limit rotation let's select minimum and rotation let's select minimum and rotation let's select minimum and maximum on all of these as well as all maximum on all of these as well as all maximum on all of these as well as all of these limit uh these different AES of these limit uh these different AES of these limit uh these different AES AES we do not want it to rotate so we AES we do not want it to rotate so we AES we do not want it to rotate so we added a limit rotation constraint it added a limit rotation constraint it added a limit rotation constraint it constrains this Cube uh doesn't let it constrains this Cube uh doesn't let it constrains this Cube uh doesn't let it move anywhere else doesn't let it rotate move anywhere else doesn't let it rotate move anywhere else doesn't let it rotate that's not what we want at all because that's not what we want at all because that's not what we want at all because it would rotate and fall off the cube we it would rotate and fall off the cube we it would rotate and fall off the cube we want it to stay on want it to stay on want it to stay on top so so let's top so so let's top so so let's set this minimum y to two and set this minimum y to two and set this minimum y to two and two that doesn't work so I think it two that doesn't work so I think it two that doesn't work so I think it would be 0.1 and would be 0.1 and would be 0.1 and 0.1 yes that's right minimum X we just 0.1 yes that's right minimum X we just 0.1 yes that's right minimum X we just leave it leave it leave it zero and CU we don't want it moving zero and CU we don't want it moving zero and CU we don't want it moving anywhere else minimum Z we want to set anywhere else minimum Z we want to set anywhere else minimum Z we want to set to 6.7 actually Z I think it was maximum Z 6.7 actually Z I think it was maximum Z 6.7 actually Z I think it was maximum Z 6.7 that's 6.7 that's 6.7 that's right there we right there we right there we go and the minimum will just be left at go and the minimum will just be left at go and the minimum will just be left at zero this the setting for this will be zero this the setting for this will be zero this the setting for this will be we'll go to the physics tab make this a we'll go to the physics tab make this a we'll go to the physics tab make this a rigid body but it will be passive so and rigid body but it will be passive so and rigid body but it will be passive so and it will we'll select animated because it will we'll select animated because it will we'll select animated because it's animated and it's going to be it's animated and it's going to be it's animated and it's going to be passive because it's uh passive because it's uh passive because it's uh it's not going to be a rigid body we it's not going to be a rigid body we it's not going to be a rigid body we don't want it to be so this should don't want it to be so this should don't want it to be so this should work actually have to bake this again I work actually have to bake this again I work actually have to bake this again I think free all bakes bake all think free all bakes bake all think free all bakes bake all Dynamics and yes it works it actually Dynamics and yes it works it actually Dynamics and yes it works it actually goes through which we do not goes through which we do not goes through which we do not want that might be let me do free all bakes yes that's because of the origin point yes that's because of the origin point yes that's because of the origin point and where it and where it and where it is so we will set this is so we will set this is so we will set this to box see how that works doesn't work too box see how that works doesn't work too box see how that works doesn't work too well let's just leave it convex hole well let's just leave it convex hole well let's just leave it convex hole okay that works let's leave it there works let's leave it there works let's leave it there and we want to animate this this needs and we want to animate this this needs and we want to animate this this needs to be moving so let's go ahead and to be moving so let's go ahead and to be moving so let's go ahead and select I select I select I scaling let's select key bake sound to F scaling let's select key bake sound to F scaling let's select key bake sound to F curves let's select our music bake sound curves let's select our music bake sound curves let's select our music bake sound F F F curves and whoops I did the wrong thing curves and whoops I did the wrong thing curves and whoops I did the wrong thing wasn't supposed to bake it to all of wasn't supposed to bake it to all of wasn't supposed to bake it to all of these supposed to only bake it to the Z these supposed to only bake it to the Z these supposed to only bake it to the Z scale so I'm going to select only zscale scale so I'm going to select only zscale scale so I'm going to select only zscale or I can select it down here key B sound or I can select it down here key B sound or I can select it down here key B sound F curves and select our music B sound F F curves and select our music B sound F F curves and select our music B sound F curves now it should curves now it should curves now it should animate yes it's animating and it's animate yes it's animating and it's animate yes it's animating and it's making the cube bounce and actually it is supposed to be bounce and actually it is supposed to be bounce and actually it is supposed to be moving more than moving more than moving more than that let's see minimum that let's see minimum that let's see minimum Z zero so the m z is about7 I think negative. think negative. think negative. 7 something like 7 something like 7 something like that 7.7 yes that's right so now it will 7.7 yes that's right so now it will 7.7 yes that's right so now it will bounce whenever this Cube moves so bounce whenever this Cube moves so bounce whenever this Cube moves so that's perfect that's just what we want that's perfect that's just what we want that's perfect that's just what we want let's go ahead and add the music in here let's go ahead and add the music in here let's go ahead and add the music in here oops this U editing and oops this U editing and oops this U editing and scripting let's go add in not a image a sound let's add in this sound and it's sound let's add in this sound and it's sound let's add in this sound and it's perfectly flush against the first frame perfectly flush against the first frame perfectly flush against the first frame which is just what we want and which is just what we want and which is just what we want and now there we now there we now there we go and we need to do this right here go and we need to do this right here go and we need to do
