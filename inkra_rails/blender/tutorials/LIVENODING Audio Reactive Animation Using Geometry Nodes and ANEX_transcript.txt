Kind: captions Language: en hello and welcome back to learn social hello and welcome back to learn social hello and welcome back to learn social life and in this episode i'll be sharing life and in this episode i'll be sharing life and in this episode i'll be sharing with you how i created this with you how i created this with you how i created this uh setup using animation nodes and uh setup using animation nodes and uh setup using animation nodes and geometry nodes geometry nodes geometry nodes so the setup is simple this is a test so the setup is simple this is a test so the setup is simple this is a test recording recording recording so there's a sound audio running in the so there's a sound audio running in the so there's a sound audio running in the background background background and you see there's a bunch of ecosphere and you see there's a bunch of ecosphere and you see there's a bunch of ecosphere that's kind of that's kind of that's kind of uh reacting into that audio let me show uh reacting into that audio let me show uh reacting into that audio let me show you the audio first you the audio first you the audio first it's under video sequence editor it's under video sequence editor it's under video sequence editor this is the voice that i recorded i can this is the voice that i recorded i can this is the voice that i recorded i can anytime change this audio and record anytime change this audio and record anytime change this audio and record different audio and it should give a different audio and it should give a different audio and it should give a different result this is a test recording so let me try this is a test recording so let me try this is a test recording so let me try like if i delete that audio and like if i delete that audio and like if i delete that audio and test recording this is a push-to-talk test recording this is a push-to-talk test recording this is a push-to-talk add-on add-on add-on for blender so just for blender so just for blender so just do a quick test recording do a quick test recording do a quick test recording and if we turn on waveform and if we turn on waveform and if we turn on waveform [Music] [Music] [Music] do a quick test recording so you can see do a quick test recording so you can see do a quick test recording so you can see it's a it's a it's a quite real time and reactive quite real time and reactive quite real time and reactive so the audio is controlling the nodes so the audio is controlling the nodes so the audio is controlling the nodes so what's going on really this is all so what's going on really this is all so what's going on really this is all the nodes under 10 nodes that you can the nodes under 10 nodes that you can the nodes under 10 nodes that you can just set up very very quickly just set up very very quickly just set up very very quickly this is animation nodes right as you this is animation nodes right as you this is animation nodes right as you already know already know already know this guy can take an audio and this guy can take an audio and this guy can take an audio and you can sample it based on these counts you can sample it based on these counts you can sample it based on these counts so i assemble it so i assemble it so i assemble it 20 times that's why we have i think 20 times that's why we have i think 20 times that's why we have i think kind of like a 20 sound samples kind of like a 20 sound samples kind of like a 20 sound samples anyhow this goes inside set custom anyhow this goes inside set custom anyhow this goes inside set custom attributes so this is actually attributes so this is actually attributes so this is actually quite interesting notes with uh quite interesting notes with uh quite interesting notes with uh animation notes this is like a animation animation notes this is like a animation animation notes this is like a animation notes notes notes with extra i think it's coming from with extra i think it's coming from with extra i think it's coming from cool lip color vfx and cool lip color vfx and cool lip color vfx and this is this guy is sending data into this is this guy is sending data into this is this guy is sending data into geometric nodes so this is geometric nodes so this is geometric nodes so this is quite advanced the notes is simple quite advanced the notes is simple quite advanced the notes is simple but it's a in order to do this you might but it's a in order to do this you might but it's a in order to do this you might need some understanding need some understanding need some understanding of what's going on so the notes is of what's going on so the notes is of what's going on so the notes is saying that saying that saying that in order to see the data i just remove in order to see the data i just remove in order to see the data i just remove the instance the instance the instance for now you can see this is the for now you can see this is the for now you can see this is the am animation nodes attributes custom am animation nodes attributes custom am animation nodes attributes custom attributes attributes attributes that's been passed into the queue that's been passed into the queue that's been passed into the queue and then we have this custom and then we have this custom and then we have this custom data coming in the number of points data coming in the number of points data coming in the number of points from here is not matching here but we from here is not matching here but we from here is not matching here but we can can can always adjust it so we have now 25 data always adjust it so we have now 25 data always adjust it so we have now 25 data in real time this audio is turned into a in real time this audio is turned into a in real time this audio is turned into a value value value that's kind of being transferred into that's kind of being transferred into that's kind of being transferred into the instance object the instance object the instance object over here okay so it's quite over here okay so it's quite over here okay so it's quite advanced like i quick test recording do a quick test recording so do a quick test recording so do a quick test recording so yeah um but you get that kind of neat yeah um but you get that kind of neat yeah um but you get that kind of neat effects very very quickly and effects very very quickly and effects very very quickly and and you can even simplify further and you can even simplify further and you can even simplify further simplify the queue further and then simplify the queue further and then simplify the queue further and then randomize the positions randomize the positions randomize the positions and if we check how what's the number 90 seconds this sample is 97 times do a quick test recording so i think we don't actually need that so i think we don't actually need that so i think we don't actually need that one but many one but many one but many do a quick test recording it's more do a quick test recording it's more do a quick test recording it's more interesting like this interesting like this interesting like this so just 20 times sampling of the audio so just 20 times sampling of the audio so just 20 times sampling of the audio and then the value is kind of scattered and then the value is kind of scattered and then the value is kind of scattered randomly anyway it's like a random test randomly anyway it's like a random test randomly anyway it's like a random test recording but it looks like recording but it looks like recording but it looks like reactive quick test recording imagine reactive quick test recording imagine reactive quick test recording imagine having this like uh having this like uh having this like uh as augmented reality objects you know as augmented reality objects you know as augmented reality objects you know like scattered points like scattered points like scattered points that's reacting to your voice based on that's reacting to your voice based on that's reacting to your voice based on the distance of you the distance of you the distance of you it's a pretty interesting stuff you can it's a pretty interesting stuff you can it's a pretty interesting stuff you can do oh yeah if you are interested with this oh yeah if you are interested with this oh yeah if you are interested with this it's a it's an add-on that you can add it's a it's an add-on that you can add it's a it's an add-on that you can add push to talk by enes and francesco so once you by enes and francesco so once you by enes and francesco so once you install this install this install this you have this recorder inside video you have this recorder inside video you have this recorder inside video sequence editor inside blender sequence editor inside blender sequence editor inside blender testing one two three tests testing one two three tests testing one two three tests so these testing one two three press so this testing one two three press so this testing one two three press so this actually save actually save actually save save the audio inside your folder save the audio inside your folder save the audio inside your folder somewhere so push to talk add-on somewhere so push to talk add-on somewhere so push to talk add-on it's using the built-in microphone you it's using the built-in microphone you it's using the built-in microphone you can specify the folder can specify the folder can specify the folder it's going to save it as wav file and it's going to save it as wav file and it's going to save it as wav file and blender will reload it blender will reload it blender will reload it and you have this you can simply specify and you have this you can simply specify and you have this you can simply specify the audio inside animation nodes the audio inside animation nodes the audio inside animation nodes and just transfer the data into geometry and just transfer the data into geometry and just transfer the data into geometry notes notes notes all right so it's quite all right so it's quite all right so it's quite advanced but pretty cool stuff you can advanced but pretty cool stuff you can advanced but pretty cool stuff you can do this is just the basics alright so do this is just the basics alright so do this is just the basics alright so i'm just showing you i'm just showing you i'm just showing you the whole thing is working together all the whole thing is working together all the whole thing is working together all right so thanks again for tuning in and right so thanks again for tuning in and right so thanks again for tuning in and i'll see you next time thank you i'll see you next time thank you i'll see you next time thank you bye
