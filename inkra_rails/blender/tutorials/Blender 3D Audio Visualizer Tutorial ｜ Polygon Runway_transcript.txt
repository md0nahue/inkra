Kind: captions Language: en [Music] [Music] [Music] hey everyone welcome to my tutorial hey everyone welcome to my tutorial hey everyone welcome to my tutorial today we are going to create this cool today we are going to create this cool today we are going to create this cool audio visualizer animation and I really audio visualizer animation and I really audio visualizer animation and I really hope you will enjoy this one and if you hope you will enjoy this one and if you hope you will enjoy this one and if you do don't forget to leave that like and do don't forget to leave that like and do don't forget to leave that like and if you're new around here hit that if you're new around here hit that if you're new around here hit that subscribe let's now jump right into subscribe let's now jump right into subscribe let's now jump right into empty blender file and the default Cube empty blender file and the default Cube empty blender file and the default Cube gets to shine again because we were gets to shine again because we were gets to shine again because we were going to use it so just delete the light going to use it so just delete the light going to use it so just delete the light here press X and delete and now select here press X and delete and now select here press X and delete and now select the cube uh because what I like to do uh the cube uh because what I like to do uh the cube uh because what I like to do uh with these audio files I like to do like with these audio files I like to do like with these audio files I like to do like an indirect method where I animate one an indirect method where I animate one an indirect method where I animate one of the objects and then use its values of the objects and then use its values of the objects and then use its values um throughout the scene so let's expand um throughout the scene so let's expand um throughout the scene so let's expand the timeline here a little bit and then the timeline here a little bit and then the timeline here a little bit and then let's expand one more window right there let's expand one more window right there let's expand one more window right there and let's switch this to video and let's switch this to video and let's switch this to video sequencer and right here we are going to sequencer and right here we are going to sequencer and right here we are going to need the graph editor you can just hover need the graph editor you can just hover need the graph editor you can just hover here and hit control Tab and you will here and hit control Tab and you will here and hit control Tab and you will switch to graph editor now let's press n switch to graph editor now let's press n switch to graph editor now let's press n for the side panel in the viewport and for the side panel in the viewport and for the side panel in the viewport and in the item menu let's insert the Z in the item menu let's insert the Z in the item menu let's insert the Z location for the cube so right click and location for the cube so right click and location for the cube so right click and insert single key frame on frame one insert single key frame on frame one insert single key frame on frame one here and that's all we need there and here and that's all we need there and here and that's all we need there and now basically you just need to pick the now basically you just need to pick the now basically you just need to pick the audio file and bake the sound wave into audio file and bake the sound wave into audio file and bake the sound wave into the graph so here in the 4.2 you go into the graph so here in the 4.2 you go into the graph so here in the 4.2 you go into Channel and choose sound to samples and Channel and choose sound to samples and Channel and choose sound to samples and just choose your audio file here it can just choose your audio file here it can just choose your audio file here it can be whatever audio file you would like to be whatever audio file you would like to be whatever audio file you would like to have I unfortunately cannot pack this um have I unfortunately cannot pack this um have I unfortunately cannot pack this um because it's a licensed so but you can because it's a licensed so but you can because it's a licensed so but you can go ahead and search for you know go ahead and search for you know go ahead and search for you know royaltyfree um soundtracks or anything royaltyfree um soundtracks or anything royaltyfree um soundtracks or anything and use something like that so and use something like that so and use something like that so immediately you can see the sound is immediately you can see the sound is immediately you can see the sound is baked here into the graph and we can baked here into the graph and we can baked here into the graph and we can just play it back and the cube will just play it back and the cube will just play it back and the cube will animate based on the audio file but the animate based on the audio file but the animate based on the audio file but the audio file is not playing here so you audio file is not playing here so you audio file is not playing here so you would need to insert that into the would need to insert that into the would need to insert that into the channel right there so I will just drag channel right there so I will just drag channel right there so I will just drag the same track right there into the the same track right there into the the same track right there into the channel one and then move it to frame channel one and then move it to frame channel one and then move it to frame one so now this is synchronized and we can now basically synchronized and we can now basically synchronized and we can now basically just collapse just collapse just collapse this and move the cube out of the way so this and move the cube out of the way so this and move the cube out of the way so I will scale it down a little bit press I will scale it down a little bit press I will scale it down a little bit press G then Y and move it to the side here it G then Y and move it to the side here it G then Y and move it to the side here it will still jump up and down here and now will still jump up and down here and now will still jump up and down here and now if you want to have this as a looping if you want to have this as a looping if you want to have this as a looping animation for example you might want to animation for example you might want to animation for example you might want to find the part you want to Loop the thing find the part you want to Loop the thing find the part you want to Loop the thing you can do is to cut the sound file you can do is to cut the sound file you can do is to cut the sound file beforehand but it's quite destructive so beforehand but it's quite destructive so beforehand but it's quite destructive so what I like to do is to just set the what I like to do is to just set the what I like to do is to just set the first and the last frame of the first and the last frame of the first and the last frame of the animation depending on the loop I have animation depending on the loop I have animation depending on the loop I have so let me hit control tab here in the so let me hit control tab here in the so let me hit control tab here in the graph editor and I located a nice Loop graph editor and I located a nice Loop graph editor and I located a nice Loop starting at frame 1200 and ending at starting at frame 1200 and ending at starting at frame 1200 and ending at 1523 if you feel like this is too fast 1523 if you feel like this is too fast 1523 if you feel like this is too fast for you or you don't understand some for you or you don't understand some for you or you don't understand some Core Concepts make sure to check out my Core Concepts make sure to check out my Core Concepts make sure to check out my courses I carefully designed them to courses I carefully designed them to courses I carefully designed them to take you from beginner skills through take you from beginner skills through take you from beginner skills through Lal illustration all the way to full Lal illustration all the way to full Lal illustration all the way to full character illustration text sh character illustration text sh character illustration text sh environments and much more and I build environments and much more and I build environments and much more and I build the courses as creative projects each the courses as creative projects each the courses as creative projects each with its own style and every time with its own style and every time with its own style and every time there's a new technique or something there's a new technique or something there's a new technique or something needs explaining we stop for a while and needs explaining we stop for a while and needs explaining we stop for a while and you get an in-depth explanation but in you get an in-depth explanation but in you get an in-depth explanation but in the end you still get a full project the end you still get a full project the end you still get a full project result so if you're interested please result so if you're interested please result so if you're interested please check out the link in the description so check out the link in the description so check out the link in the description so now if I zoom this out you can see the now if I zoom this out you can see the now if I zoom this out you can see the active timeline is right there and active timeline is right there and active timeline is right there and that's what I'm going to use um but you that's what I'm going to use um but you that's what I'm going to use um but you can easily uh just switch this you know can easily uh just switch this you know can easily uh just switch this you know move your start and end frame to locate move your start and end frame to locate move your start and end frame to locate the part of the sound you want to be the part of the sound you want to be the part of the sound you want to be playing and it's much easier than to you playing and it's much easier than to you playing and it's much easier than to you know bake the sound all over again and know bake the sound all over again and know bake the sound all over again and the reason I have it baked on the cube the reason I have it baked on the cube the reason I have it baked on the cube is that I can now just add any object so is that I can now just add any object so is that I can now just add any object so first of all let's go edit preferences first of all let's go edit preferences first of all let's go edit preferences and here in your blender um you get the and here in your blender um you get the and here in your blender um you get the add-on still and if you first launch it add-on still and if you first launch it add-on still and if you first launch it you should have an option to install you should have an option to install you should have an option to install these as an extensions because that's these as an extensions because that's these as an extensions because that's like the new system um there's now like the new system um there's now like the new system um there's now unified storage for all the add-ons unified storage for all the add-ons unified storage for all the add-ons Community add-ons default add-ons that Community add-ons default add-ons that Community add-ons default add-ons that come with bunder and these are called come with bunder and these are called come with bunder and these are called extensions and you can just locate them extensions and you can just locate them extensions and you can just locate them and install right here so right now just and install right here so right now just and install right here so right now just locate the extra mesh objects extension locate the extra mesh objects extension locate the extra mesh objects extension and click install if you don't have it and click install if you don't have it and click install if you don't have it installed yet you can search for installed yet you can search for installed yet you can search for extensions right here and then you will extensions right here and then you will extensions right here and then you will see it active in the add-on section see it active in the add-on section see it active in the add-on section right there and then just close the right there and then just close the right there and then just close the preferences and now you can press Shi a preferences and now you can press Shi a preferences and now you can press Shi a add mesh and from the extra objects you add mesh and from the extra objects you add mesh and from the extra objects you can pick the round can pick the round can pick the round Cube and right here we are going to Cube and right here we are going to Cube and right here we are going to increase the increase the increase the radius and divisions to something like radius and divisions to something like radius and divisions to something like 10 so we have a sphere made out of quads 10 so we have a sphere made out of quads 10 so we have a sphere made out of quads and now we'll press contrl 2 to add and now we'll press contrl 2 to add and now we'll press contrl 2 to add subdivision surface modifier you can see subdivision surface modifier you can see subdivision surface modifier you can see right here in the right here in the right here in the modifiers or you can just go ahead and modifiers or you can just go ahead and modifiers or you can just go ahead and add it you know through the menu and set add it you know through the menu and set add it you know through the menu and set the levels of f port to two and now the levels of f port to two and now the levels of f port to two and now right click Shades mode and here I'm right click Shades mode and here I'm right click Shades mode and here I'm just going to add simple displace just going to add simple displace just going to add simple displace modifier so let's add modifier the form modifier so let's add modifier the form modifier so let's add modifier the form and dis and dis and dis place and we are going to create a new place and we are going to create a new place and we are going to create a new texture texture texture there let's go to the texture settings there let's go to the texture settings there let's go to the texture settings and for this one I use the wood texture and for this one I use the wood texture and for this one I use the wood texture but I changed bands to band noise and reduce the turbolence all the noise and reduce the turbolence all the noise and reduce the turbolence all the way to zero for now and now the way to zero for now and now the way to zero for now and now the advantage of having the sound wave baked advantage of having the sound wave baked advantage of having the sound wave baked on another object I can just use the on another object I can just use the on another object I can just use the value of this object um wherever I want value of this object um wherever I want value of this object um wherever I want whether it's as a driver in these you whether it's as a driver in these you whether it's as a driver in these you know modifier settings or you can use it know modifier settings or you can use it know modifier settings or you can use it in Geometry notes or what have you so in Geometry notes or what have you so in Geometry notes or what have you so right here I will use it as a driver um right here I will use it as a driver um right here I will use it as a driver um so let me expand this part a little bit so let me expand this part a little bit so let me expand this part a little bit and right here let's go back to the and right here let's go back to the and right here let's go back to the modifiers and in the display modifier modifiers and in the display modifier modifiers and in the display modifier let's just right click the strength and let's just right click the strength and let's just right click the strength and choose add driver and you can click away choose add driver and you can click away choose add driver and you can click away uh you can see this turning Violet and uh you can see this turning Violet and uh you can see this turning Violet and that means there's a driver there now so that means there's a driver there now so that means there's a driver there now so right here you can switch this to right here you can switch this to right here you can switch this to drivers and right here you have the drivers and right here you have the drivers and right here you have the driver driver driver curve and if you select the driver and curve and if you select the driver and curve and if you select the driver and choose drivers here if you don't have choose drivers here if you don't have choose drivers here if you don't have this option right there just press n to this option right there just press n to this option right there just press n to expand the side panel you will see the expand the side panel you will see the expand the side panel you will see the same settings as you would when you same settings as you would when you same settings as you would when you right click here and choose edit driver right click here and choose edit driver right click here and choose edit driver here in the pop-up menu so let me zoom here in the pop-up menu so let me zoom here in the pop-up menu so let me zoom in a little bit here because the curve is really here because the curve is really here because the curve is really important you can see it goes from 0 0 important you can see it goes from 0 0 important you can see it goes from 0 0 to 1 one so that's basically like a to 1 one so that's basically like a to 1 one so that's basically like a value mapping for this so right now this value mapping for this so right now this value mapping for this so right now this will be linear and I will get back to will be linear and I will get back to will be linear and I will get back to this later but let's set up the driver this later but let's set up the driver this later but let's set up the driver right there in the driver you have if right there in the driver you have if right there in the driver you have if you keep the type as a scripted you keep the type as a scripted you keep the type as a scripted expression you have the expression right expression you have the expression right expression you have the expression right there and then you have these input there and then you have these input there and then you have these input variables and you can see the default variables and you can see the default variables and you can see the default this right there it's called VAR and this right there it's called VAR and this right there it's called VAR and it's used in the expression you can call it's used in the expression you can call it's used in the expression you can call this whatever you want so for example in this whatever you want so for example in this whatever you want so for example in this case we can call this this case we can call this this case we can call this wave and we can switch this to wave you wave and we can switch this to wave you wave and we can switch this to wave you will see it will start working again so will see it will start working again so will see it will start working again so here you create the variables and here here you create the variables and here here you create the variables and here in the expression you use them and the in the expression you use them and the in the expression you use them and the wave gets populated by whatever you wave gets populated by whatever you wave gets populated by whatever you configure here so here I want to use the configure here so here I want to use the configure here so here I want to use the cube object and I want to use its Z cube object and I want to use its Z cube object and I want to use its Z location for this variable so right now location for this variable so right now location for this variable so right now if I play this if I play this if I play this back you will see this value is back you will see this value is back you will see this value is animating based on the bouncing of the animating based on the bouncing of the animating based on the bouncing of the cube so that's the gist of drivers and cube so that's the gist of drivers and cube so that's the gist of drivers and you can remove whatever you have in the you can remove whatever you have in the you can remove whatever you have in the Expressions you can just directly use Expressions you can just directly use Expressions you can just directly use the bra value and then you can start the bra value and then you can start the bra value and then you can start playing with the Curve so right here you playing with the Curve so right here you playing with the Curve so right here you can see the actual values with the dash can see the actual values with the dash can see the actual values with the dash lines you can see how it bounces up and lines you can see how it bounces up and lines you can see how it bounces up and down on that expression on that curve down on that expression on that curve down on that expression on that curve and you can change the curve right and you can change the curve right and you can change the curve right here from value from 0 to one and change here from value from 0 to one and change here from value from 0 to one and change its Behavior a little bit you will see its Behavior a little bit you will see its Behavior a little bit you will see it will still bounce on the curve but it will still bounce on the curve but it will still bounce on the curve but now since I changed the curve and the now since I changed the curve and the now since I changed the curve and the extremes are a little bit more subtle extremes are a little bit more subtle extremes are a little bit more subtle you know so for this case I would keep you know so for this case I would keep you know so for this case I would keep it like this and then if I want to you it like this and then if I want to you it like this and then if I want to you know make it even more subtle I can you know make it even more subtle I can you know make it even more subtle I can you know subtract from that expression so I know subtract from that expression so I know subtract from that expression so I can use something like minus 0.8 or can use something like minus 0.8 or can use something like minus 0.8 or something and now you can see the range something and now you can see the range something and now you can see the range is a little bit different and I can do is a little bit different and I can do is a little bit different and I can do even more I can do like 0.9 and then you can multiply the whole 0.9 and then you can multiply the whole 0.9 and then you can multiply the whole thing by for example 1.2 so you can thing by for example 1.2 so you can thing by for example 1.2 so you can really play with the numbers here and really play with the numbers here and really play with the numbers here and get the desired Behavior you know get the desired Behavior you know get the desired Behavior you know convert the original value of the cube convert the original value of the cube convert the original value of the cube jump up and down to whatever values you jump up and down to whatever values you jump up and down to whatever values you want to see here in the displacement want to see here in the displacement want to see here in the displacement strength and then you can still go to strength and then you can still go to strength and then you can still go to the texture settings and play with the the texture settings and play with the the texture settings and play with the values like turbulence so you can make values like turbulence so you can make values like turbulence so you can make it more funky and then you know play it more funky and then you know play it more funky and then you know play with the size so the mapping is not so with the size so the mapping is not so with the size so the mapping is not so aggressive we can maybe increase the aggressive we can maybe increase the aggressive we can maybe increase the levels of the subdivision levels of the subdivision levels of the subdivision surface maybe even more but be careful surface maybe even more but be careful surface maybe even more but be careful about the FPS it can start going down about the FPS it can start going down about the FPS it can start going down and one important thing to mention I and one important thing to mention I and one important thing to mention I left this at 25 FPS if you for example left this at 25 FPS if you for example left this at 25 FPS if you for example want 30 FPS you need to bake your sound want 30 FPS you need to bake your sound want 30 FPS you need to bake your sound again obviously because the timing would again obviously because the timing would again obviously because the timing would be a little bit different so if you want be a little bit different so if you want be a little bit different so if you want to change FPS here um just go ahead and to change FPS here um just go ahead and to change FPS here um just go ahead and bake the sound again and it will just bake the sound again and it will just bake the sound again and it will just work out of the box and then of course work out of the box and then of course work out of the box and then of course adjust the frame range for the animation adjust the frame range for the animation adjust the frame range for the animation because that would be a little bit because that would be a little bit because that would be a little bit different so basically that's all I used different so basically that's all I used different so basically that's all I used for this type of audio visual now you for this type of audio visual now you for this type of audio visual now you can play with the details like for can play with the details like for can play with the details like for example in the texture you might want to example in the texture you might want to example in the texture you might want to play um with the size or the turbulence play um with the size or the turbulence play um with the size or the turbulence of this but you don't necessarily need of this but you don't necessarily need of this but you don't necessarily need to map this to driver so we can just to map this to driver so we can just to map this to driver so we can just switch this to you know timeline go to switch this to you know timeline go to switch this to you know timeline go to start of the animation and for example start of the animation and for example start of the animation and for example do like turbulance of one and insert key do like turbulance of one and insert key do like turbulance of one and insert key frame here then in the timeline press frame here then in the timeline press frame here then in the timeline press shift d to duplicated on the other shift d to duplicated on the other shift d to duplicated on the other side and then here in the middle we can side and then here in the middle we can side and then here in the middle we can you know increase this a little bit so you know increase this a little bit so you know increase this a little bit so it looks a little bit more interesting it looks a little bit more interesting it looks a little bit more interesting right click and insert single key frame right click and insert single key frame right click and insert single key frame and now the animation will kind of and now the animation will kind of and now the animation will kind of animate through the texture noise but animate through the texture noise but animate through the texture noise but the scale or the strength of the the scale or the strength of the the scale or the strength of the displacement will be still mapped to the displacement will be still mapped to the displacement will be still mapped to the sound level you have right there and sound level you have right there and sound level you have right there and then what I did for the animation I just then what I did for the animation I just then what I did for the animation I just created background so let me just do created background so let me just do created background so let me just do that real quick here tab into the edit that real quick here tab into the edit that real quick here tab into the edit mode press s to scale it up right click mode press s to scale it up right click mode press s to scale it up right click choose subdivide and press shift R choose subdivide and press shift R choose subdivide and press shift R several times to get more dense mesh Tab several times to get more dense mesh Tab several times to get more dense mesh Tab out press G then Z and move it down and out press G then Z and move it down and out press G then Z and move it down and then basically just going to the then basically just going to the then basically just going to the modifiers add that subdivision surface modifiers add that subdivision surface modifiers add that subdivision surface modifier again and another displacement and here I used something displacement and here I used something displacement and here I used something like a cloud like a cloud like a cloud texture with a large size right click texture with a large size right click texture with a large size right click shade smooth or or maybe you can go for shade smooth or or maybe you can go for shade smooth or or maybe you can go for something like a distorted something like a distorted something like a distorted noise that looks quite cool and then I noise that looks quite cool and then I noise that looks quite cool and then I used the trick for looping animation used the trick for looping animation used the trick for looping animation where I use the empty so let's press where I use the empty so let's press where I use the empty so let's press shift a add an empty let's press shift d shift a add an empty let's press shift d shift a add an empty let's press shift d and press y to move it to the side a and press y to move it to the side a and press y to move it to the side a little bit and then hold control click little bit and then hold control click little bit and then hold control click it in the outliner Press contrl p in the it in the outliner Press contrl p in the it in the outliner Press contrl p in the viewport and choose to parent and now viewport and choose to parent and now viewport and choose to parent and now click the original one again and in the click the original one again and in the click the original one again and in the frame one or you know whatever frame you frame one or you know whatever frame you frame one or you know whatever frame you your animation starts just right click your animation starts just right click your animation starts just right click the X rotation and insert single key the X rotation and insert single key the X rotation and insert single key frame move to the end of the animation frame move to the end of the animation frame move to the end of the animation and let's change this to 360 right click and let's change this to 360 right click and let's change this to 360 right click and insert single key frame so the main and insert single key frame so the main and insert single key frame so the main empty will rotate and take this that's empty will rotate and take this that's empty will rotate and take this that's on the side with it uh just make sure in on the side with it uh just make sure in on the side with it uh just make sure in the timeline with all the key frames the timeline with all the key frames the timeline with all the key frames selected press T and choose linear selected press T and choose linear selected press T and choose linear interpolation so it starts at speed and interpolation so it starts at speed and interpolation so it starts at speed and doesn't accelerate and now we'll use doesn't accelerate and now we'll use doesn't accelerate and now we'll use this empty to map this texture so let's this empty to map this texture so let's this empty to map this texture so let's go to the modifier panel and for the go to the modifier panel and for the go to the modifier panel and for the coordinates we'll use object and just coordinates we'll use object and just coordinates we'll use object and just pick this empty right here you can see pick this empty right here you can see pick this empty right here you can see now this is animating you can of course now this is animating you can of course now this is animating you can of course map this uh to the cube movement through map this uh to the cube movement through map this uh to the cube movement through some driver expression or you know some driver expression or you know some driver expression or you know geometry nodes and now I can just select geometry nodes and now I can just select geometry nodes and now I can just select this empty right here and scale it up this empty right here and scale it up this empty right here and scale it up and down to adjust the waves and now and down to adjust the waves and now and down to adjust the waves and now let's look from the camera and I think let's look from the camera and I think let's look from the camera and I think this will need to be a little bit larger this will need to be a little bit larger this will need to be a little bit larger here here here and yeah basically that's it that's all and yeah basically that's it that's all and yeah basically that's it that's all I used now for the I used now for the I used now for the material let's select the object and material let's select the object and material let's select the object and let's switch this to Shader editor press let's switch this to Shader editor press let's switch this to Shader editor press contrl B to limit the preview only to contrl B to limit the preview only to contrl B to limit the preview only to camera bounds and let's go to render camera bounds and let's go to render camera bounds and let's go to render settings switch to Cycles enable GPU and settings switch to Cycles enable GPU and settings switch to Cycles enable GPU and the noising right the noising right the noising right here and something like 128 samples here and something like 128 samples here and something like 128 samples should be fine and now let's P shift a should be fine and now let's P shift a should be fine and now let's P shift a and let's add a light area light press G and let's add a light area light press G and let's add a light area light press G then Z move it up a little then Z move it up a little then Z move it up a little bit and let's make it a little bit bit and let's make it a little bit bit and let's make it a little bit larger and let's increase to something larger and let's increase to something larger and let's increase to something like 500 and press Z and preview the like 500 and press Z and preview the like 500 and press Z and preview the rendered animation so this is what we rendered animation so this is what we rendered animation so this is what we have here and now I'll select the object have here and now I'll select the object have here and now I'll select the object create a new create a new create a new material and I really like the material and I really like the material and I really like the combination of you know gray scale and combination of you know gray scale and combination of you know gray scale and strong orange saturated color so that's strong orange saturated color so that's strong orange saturated color so that's what I went here for and redu the what I went here for and redu the what I went here for and redu the roughness all the way to zero this can roughness all the way to zero this can roughness all the way to zero this can be a bit brighter be a bit brighter be a bit brighter here um but I wanted to give this you here um but I wanted to give this you here um but I wanted to give this you know a little bit of a
