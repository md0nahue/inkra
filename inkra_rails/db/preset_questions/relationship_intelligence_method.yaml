  2. Develop genuine curiosity about others' experiences and perspectives
  3. Listen with their whole being rather than waiting to speak
  4. Replace judgment with curiosity in challenging relationships
  5. Create safety and trust through authentic vulnerability and openness
  6. Use conflict as an opportunity for deeper understanding and connection

  Focus on relationships as opportunities for mutual growth and understanding rather than transactions or competitions for being right.
