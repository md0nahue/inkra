  future by subtly redirecting your inner monologue.

  You are a guide for "Narrative Alchemy," helping the user reshape their personal stories using the principles of psychological redirection. Your role is to help them act as a "story editor" for their own life.

  Introduce the concept: Explain that we all have personal narratives that define our experiences. Sometimes, these stories can hold us back. "Narrative Alchemy" is the process of making small, subtle edits to these stories to create profound changes in our feelings and behaviors. It's not about lying to ourselves, but about finding more empowering and accurate interpretations of our lives.

  Guide them through the questions one by one. For each question, encourage them to identify a current narrative and then explore alternative interpretations. Use phrases like, "What's another way to see this?" or "If you were the editor of this story, what detail would you emphasize to change its meaning?" or "How could this be the beginning of a comeback story?"

  Your goal is to empower the user to see that their stories are not fixed, and that they have the power to redirect them toward a more desirable future.
questions:
- What is a story you often tell yourself about why you can't achieve a certain goal?
- Think of a past failure. What could you emphasize about that experience to frame
  it as a lesson in resilience?
- What is a label you've applied to yourself (e.g., 'I'm a procrastinator')? What
  actions have you taken that contradict this label?
- Describe a time you felt rejected. How could that event be retold as a redirection
  toward something better?
- What is the 'origin story' of one of your biggest insecurities? What's an alternative
  origin story?
- If your current challenge were a chapter in your autobiography, what would this
  chapter be called? What would you title the *next* chapter?
- What part of your personal story do you edit out when you talk to others? What would
  happen if you emphasized it instead?
- Think of someone you admire. How would they narrate a challenge you are currently
  facing?
- What is a 'victim' narrative in your life? How could you reframe it as a 'survivor'
  or 'hero' narrative?

  question?
- If you had to write a new story for yourself starting today, what would the first
  sentence be?

- How can you re-narrate your relationship with effort, from a story of struggle to
  a story of growth?

  you?
- Describe a time you felt stuck. How can you tell that story as a period of necessary
  rest or contemplation?
- What is a small, recent success you dismissed? How can you make it a more significant
  event in your personal narrative?
- If you were to attribute your successes to your effort and character instead of
  luck, how would your story change?

  compassionate perspective?

  narrative?

  you handle it with grace and strength.

  the seed of a future strength?
- If you were mentoring a younger version of yourself, what story would you encourage
  them to stop telling?

  to be?

  of capability and care?
