# INKRA MIGRATION AUDIT REPORT
## Overall Plan Assessment & Current Status
**Date**: September 15, 2025
**Audit Scope**: Massive migration from Rails/Cloud to Native iOS/AWS Serverless
**Status**: CRITICAL PHASE - Mid-migration with significant progress

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Inkra is undergoing a transformative migration from a Rails-based backend with cloud dependencies (Polly, Groq) to a native iOS app with AWS serverless infrastructure. This audit reveals a project that has overcome major blockers and is now in an advanced implementation phase.

**Key Finding**: The migration has progressed from HIGH RISK to MEDIUM RISK through comprehensive architectural improvements and safety mechanisms.

### Strategic Goals
1. **85% cost reduction** (from ~$450/month to ~$80/month)
2. **Improved performance** with native speech services
3. **Enhanced privacy** with on-device processing
4. **Reduced operational overhead** with serverless architecture
5. **Better offline capabilities** with local-first approach

### Migration Approach
**8-Phase implementation** with Phase 0 foundation work added for risk mitigation
