I should add that we need for the user rate limiting based on plan level to live somewhere so I don't know. Don't know if we can build that directly into AWS Cognito or whatever it's called Coquito yeah but if we do need to use dynamo DB for that then you know it really analyze basically there's just you know what plan level the user is at and then we need to check if they're allowed to make that request and then I don't know I mean like it would be cheaper if we could just build that into the iOS, but that means we would get hacked right like if if we did plain level enforcement in inside the mobile client like that could theoretically be hacked and then someone could violate but you know it sure would be cool if we could cut out th an additional like database database: every single request right but I guess you just can't trust the client for that but yeah, so analyze how we can do this using US resources and tell me what do you think about that?
