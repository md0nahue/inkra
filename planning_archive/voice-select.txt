# Voice Selection Redesign - Apple Native Voices

## Overview
Redesign the voice selection interface to exclusively use Apple's native text-to-speech voices, providing a streamlined and consistent user experience across all Apple devices.

## Current State Analysis
- Need to assess existing voice selection implementation
- Identify dependencies on third-party voice providers
- Evaluate current UI/UX patterns

## Apple Native Voice Categories

### English Voices
- **Enhanced Voices**: Samantha, Alex, Victoria, Fred
- **Premium Voices**: Siri voices (multiple variants)
- **Compact Voices**: Basic system voices
- **Novelty Voices**: Bad News, Bubbles, Cellos, etc.

### Multilingual Support
- Spanish: Monica, Paulina, Juan
- French: Amelie, Thomas
- German: Anna, Helena, Martin
- Italian: Alice, Luca
- Japanese: Kyoko, Otoya
- Chinese: Ting-Ting, Sin-ji

## Design Concepts

### 1. Categorized Selection
```
Voice Categories:
├── Natural (Siri-quality voices)
├── Classic (Traditional system voices)
├── Character (Novelty/themed voices)
└── Languages (Organized by locale)
```

### 2. Voice Preview System
- Inline sample playback with standardized test phrase
- Real-time voice switching during preview
- Waveform visualization for voice characteristics

### 3. Smart Recommendations
- Device-optimized voice suggestions
- Usage-based voice ordering
- Context-aware recommendations (reading vs conversation)

## Technical Implementation

### Voice Discovery
```swift
// Use AVSpeechSynthesisVoice to enumerate available voices
let voices = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.speechVoices()
let englishVoices = voices.filter { $0.language.hasPrefix("en") }
```

### Quality Tiers
- **Tier 1**: Enhanced/Neural voices (best quality)
- **Tier 2**: Standard system voices
- **Tier 3**: Compact voices (smaller download)

### Storage & Caching
- Cache voice availability checks
- Handle voice downloads for premium voices
- Graceful fallback for unavailable voices

## User Experience Flow

1. **Voice Browser**
   - Grid/list view with voice cards
   - Each card shows: name, language, quality indicator
   - Quick preview button on each card

2. **Detailed Voice View**
   - Extended sample text playback
   - Voice characteristics (speed, pitch range)
   - Download status for premium voices

3. **Selection Confirmation**
   - A/B comparison with current voice
   - Settings persistence across app sessions

## Platform Considerations

### macOS
- Access to full voice library
- System Preferences integration hints
- Voice download management

### iOS/iPadOS
- Respect system voice downloads
- Settings app integration
- Accessibility considerations

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Inventory current voice usage
2. **Phase 2**: Map existing voices to Apple equivalents
3. **Phase 3**: Implement new selection UI
4. **Phase 4**: Migrate user preferences
5. **Phase 5**: Remove legacy voice dependencies

## Accessibility Features
- VoiceOver support for voice selection
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Reduced motion alternatives
- Keyboard navigation support

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of voice previews
- Background voice availability checks
- Efficient voice switching without audio interruption
- Memory management for multiple voice instances

## Future Enhancements
- Voice cloning/customization (when Apple supports it)
- Personal voice integration (iOS 17+)
- Cross-device voice sync via iCloud
- Voice mood/emotion selection
