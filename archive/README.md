# Archive - Previous Implementation Plans

## Foreword

This folder contains the original comprehensive migration plans that were designed for a full-scale production migration from Rails to AWS. These plans included extensive infrastructure, testing frameworks, rollback mechanisms, and complex multi-phase rollouts.

**Why Archived**: For V1 prototype development, we only need the basic Gemini question generation endpoint. The complexity of these original plans was beyond the scope of getting a working prototype running.

**What's Archived**:
- `enhanced-migration-plan.md` - Comprehensive 8-week migration plan with safety mechanisms
- `implementation-progress.md` - Detailed progress tracking for the full migration
- `implementation-summary.md` - Summary of completed work for the full migration
- `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complex deployment guide for full AWS infrastructure

## Current V1 Approach

The new simplified approach focuses only on:
1. Deploy the existing `generateQuestions` Lambda function
2. Configure the Gemini API key
3. Test the endpoint from iOS
4. Get the prototype working

This reduces complexity from weeks to days and allows for rapid prototyping and validation.

## When to Reference These Files

These archived plans contain valuable information for:
- Future production deployment
- Understanding the full scope of the migration
- Learning from comprehensive error handling patterns
- Referencing testing strategies

But for V1 prototype development, they represent over-engineering.
